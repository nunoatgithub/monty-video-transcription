Thousand Brains Project: Hi, I'm Will Warren, the community manager for the Thousand Brains Project. I'm primarily responsible for the OSS community, but as you can see from the dotted line, the community impacts everything we do at the Thousand Brains Project, so we're excited to get started with you. Who am I? I'm Brainwaves on the forum, Will Warren on LinkedIn, and wwarren at thousandbrains.org by email. I enjoy when the community reaches out and has conversations with me, so please don't be shy—feel free to contact me on any of these channels.

If you're interested in Monty's Island, this new form of machine intelligence, and want to get started, you might imagine buying a boat, heading over to the open source community harbor, and seeing the many possibilities you can contribute to. These opportunities are available for the community to explore. If something excites you and you want to work on it, this is a great opportunity to get involved with the project.

How do you get started? The primary place to go is the thousandbrains.org website. This provides a high-level overview of the entire project, the company, the people involved, insights into the neocortex, the principles we've derived, and links to all the other resources available to you. It's a good place to start.

We also have a contact list, an email distribution list, at thousandbrains.org/contact. We send emails to this list about five times a year with important events such as this meetup, as well as papers we've released and other updates.

You can also contact us on LinkedIn, Twitter, or Blue Sky; that information is on the website. One of the best ways to get started and understand Monty and the Thousand Brains Project is through our YouTube channel, where we publish all our videos and research meetings. We have a playlist called Quick Start, which is about nine hours of videos and is important for explaining the underpinnings and paradigm shifts needed to understand Monty and the Thousand Brains Theory. This is a great playlist to get started.

The main hub for community interaction is our forum at thousandbrains.discourse.group. The entire company participates here, answering questions and interacting with the community. It's a great place to ask for help if you get stuck or to share interesting research for discussion. We also post all our videos as links here, allowing for discussions around the video content. For example, Matthieu posted about understanding how reference frames relate to cortical columns. Please join the forum and introduce yourself; there's an introductions channel for that.

Our code is on GitHub at thousandbrainsproject/tbp.monty. This is where all our Python code, documentation source, and tools and visualizations are maintained. This is primarily where you can contribute code and documentation changes.

We also have a documentation server at thousandbrainsproject.readme.io, which provides an exhaustive overview of everything we know about Monty and the Thousand Brains Project. At the bottom of the main page, there are technical resources for getting started, including our papers. The documentation has seven main sections. In the overview section, you'll find our benchmark experiments, showing how Monty performs against our datasets. The How to Use Monty section includes the Getting Started Guide for installing the software and tutorials for running experiments. Monty runs natively on CPU-based laptops, so you don't need GPUs or expensive machines.

The How Monty Works section explains how all the modules relate within the codebase, how learning modules work, how to connect them into a heterarchy, and how sensor modules and the environment function. The contributing section covers how to contribute to the project, documentation, tutorials, and pull requests, as well as our request for comments process for larger pieces of work. The community section discusses our code of conduct, governance, license, patent pledge, and includes a project showcase for community-built projects. The neuroscience and theory section covers all the papers we reference and those we've produced.

The seventh section, Future Work, is a large section outlining our roadmap for the next few years. Each subsection contains multiple documents, with five to ten pieces of future work we're interested in. We have an interactive widget on the project roadmap that lists all future work items, showing their titles, scope, status, the metric they improve, and the skills needed. You can filter this widget by interest and skill. For example, you might find that Tristan is scoping a particular item, and you can view all the details needed to get started.

If any of this excites you or you're interested in getting started, this is a good place to look at where you can contribute. You can contribute anywhere on this map. A great way to start is by enabling a ruff rule in our linting system. Enabling a rule will generate errors in the codebase, and fixing them is a great way to learn the pull request process and improve the code for everyone. Many of these rules are being enabled by Carver and MayMay, so thank you to them.

You can contribute to the platform and framework for larger pieces of work on the future roadmap, such as combining the data loader and dataset into a single environment interface class. This moves us toward a nomenclature of a sensorimotor system, as opposed to the deep learning terminology of datasets and data loaders. While this may look like a simple refactor, it was actually an enormous amount of work, so thank you, Anna, for doing that and committing it.

You can contribute to scaling the system. Xavier at ETH Zurich has been exploring process-in-memory chips and how we can embed learning modules in those chips to scale the system at the chip level. We believe this may be similar to how GPUs have helped deep learning scale, and we're interested to see the results. Thank you, Xavier.

You can contribute to optimization. Collin has worked closely with Tristan to back learning modules with GPUs to see if we can speed them up. You don't need GPUs to do this; it was just an optimization. We also recorded these as videos between Collin and Tristan and published them on YouTube so others can watch and get involved.

You can contribute to the simulator. AgentRev has been working on simplifying the simulator protocol and optimizing it. He has made several pull requests, and this ongoing work will allow us to switch out the simulator more easily and choose different ones in the future.

You can contribute to communication for the project. Greg Robinson has produced fantastic blog posts applying the Thousand Brains Theory to interesting aspects of human psychology. Artem Kirsanov has created a beautiful YouTube explanation of the Thousand Brains Project and how cortical columns work—it's a great introduction to a sensorimotor system. Matthew has produced beautiful visuals that have improved the flow of the documentation. AgentRev has created a tutorial for installing Monty on Windows, which we have added to our official documentation. Thank you, AgentRev. Twintails made a small but important change by fixing a broken link from one of our social media platforms in the documentation. Every little bit helps.

You can contribute to real-world examples. Zachary at Loughborough University is embedding Monty in a robot, and we're excited to see that work progress. Another real-world application was enabled when Butterfly Ultrasound gave us a probe on loan, and at our robot hackathon, we built an end-to-end process for Monty recognizing objects at the ultrasound level, which was a new modality for us.

You can contribute to sensor modules. The Penn State Computer Science Department is helping us improve feature extraction and recognition at the sensor module level.

You can help the community in general. Many people have been helping out, asking and answering questions on the forum, and posting interesting information on Twitter and our social media platforms. As Vivian mentioned, we are partially funded by the Gates Foundation and the KETI Institute, but we are now a registered charity, so if you're interested in financially supporting us, you can do so as well.

Thank you to all our supporters and contributors for getting involved. This is truly a community engagement opportunity, and we're excited to see what we accomplish in the future. We hope you enjoy your mugs. Please join us—go to thousandbrains.org or visit our forum and say hello. If you are interested in basing your master's or PhD thesis on Monty, please get in touch. We'd love to have a conversation and figure out how we can support you through that process.

With that, I'll hand it over to Jeremy, who's going to talk through the pull request process and how you can make changes to our codebase, documentation, and tools. Take it away,
