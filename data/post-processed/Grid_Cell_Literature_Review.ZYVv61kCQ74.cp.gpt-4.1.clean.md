The agenda for today's meeting is about an hour. I'll cover the basics and some recent literature on grid cells, which is a broad area. Jeff also has something to present about how movements are created, which also covers grid cells. They're very related. Grid cells are one of the hardest topics I've dealt with in neuroscience, so if you find this confusing, don't worry. When I first dove into grid cells, it took me about two months to get a decent understanding. It's really confusing. At one point, I wrote a sentence thinking it was obvious, but then realized it wasn't. It wasn't just me—Hai, myself, and others were all confused by this, so it's understandable.

Yesterday, I was mostly at urgent care with food poisoning, but after some sleep, I'm much better. Last night, I was seriously considering whether I could do this, but a good night's sleep helped. I still haven't eaten yet, but Arthur is here and wants my banana, which is my first food in 20 hours, so he can't have it. Anyway, let's start the recording from the literature review on grid cells.

I'll go over a grid cell 101—things most people can agree on. The middle portion will be dedicated to re-anchoring of grid cells, inspired by the work Anil and I are doing on an RFC for handling re-anchoring in Monty and dealing with off-object observation. That was the motivation for this review and some recent work, mainly from 2022 onward. If you search for grid cells on YouTube, Numenta has a whole course about it, with many videos from the Numenta Theory channel. I didn't watch all the videos, just FYI. One of the best resources for getting up to speed is the 2014 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine lecture, which is about three hours from the Nobel winners John O'Keefe, May-Britt Moser, and Edvard Moser on place cells and grid cells. These resources go into much more detail than I will today, but I wanted to make something accessible for the community, even for those not in systems neuroscience, since this is a difficult topic.

We don't have to implement the details of grid cells in Monty. It's very detailed cellular biology, and we generally don't want to do that unless necessary. This is mostly for inspiration about what happens when grid cells do re-anchoring. I was curious about the biological justification for doing something in Monty, so I wanted to know if there's any connection at all. Before talking about grid cells, I want to cover one slide on place cells. Many ideas in Monty wouldn't have come up if we hadn't read about grid cells, such as unique locations in space, re-anchoring, and other concepts. We knew we needed some representation of location and a reference, but we didn't understand path integration, re-anchoring, or unique representations of location. It's more than just things we got from studying grid cells—it was pretty important.

This is why we're revisiting this topic. As you said, Jeff, it underpins much of the Thousand Brains Theory. We're planning to add certain properties to how locations are updated in Monty, like re-anchoring and handling movement off an object, which is analogous to removing a mouse from an environment. It seemed worthwhile to revisit the literature and see what grid cells actually do in those settings. Does that correspond to what we want to implement? Are they different? If so, is there something interesting to consider? That's why we're doing this today.

I'll cover one slide about place cells. I'm going to show you a video with no sound. You'll see a mouse with an electrode implanted on its head, running around a square environment. The black lines indicate the mouse's trajectory, and the colorful dots show where the cell is firing. The different colors correspond to different cells.

It looks like the original recordings only captured data from one cell. I could see the red on the black. I couldn't find the original video; I think it was from too long ago. The idea is similar to the original video, except this one has ten simultaneous recordings instead of just one. In papers, these are often presented as firing rate heat maps. The size of the heat map matches the size of the room, with red indicating a high firing rate for that cell and blue indicating less activity. For one cell, it's easy to visualize, but for multiple cells, it becomes difficult to interpret when combined. That's the general idea.

Place cells seem to fire at specific locations, regardless of sensory input. This is why they're called place cells—they indicate the animal's location. While it might seem like a random fact, it's important that these cells appear to function independently from sensory inputs. John O'Keefe mentioned in his Nobel Prize lecture that this activity seems to be generated within the brain itself. This was the motivation for searching for grid cells in the first place.

If you go back to the previous slide, you'll see that the cells always fire in the same locations within the same environment. However, if the rat perceives it as a different environment, the cells fire in different locations. For example, if you put a painting on the wall and the rat perceives the room as different, the place cells remap and fire in new locations. The idea is that the brain generates this activity, but it still requires some input to determine the environment. If you turn off the lights and the rat moves in the dark, the place cells still fire, which demonstrates path integration. At times, you don't need sensory input—once you've identified the room, the cells continue to fire as you move, even without sensory input. However, it's not completely independent of sensory input because the rat still needs to determine its position in the world.

Do these cells have different scales, like grid cells? Some cells have larger firing ranges, while others are smaller. In grid cells, this is true, and I believe it's also true for place cells. As you move across the hippocampal complex, the scales of these cells change. I believe the place cell scale changes similarly to grid cells, though I'm not completely certain. You generally don't see place cells and grid cells of different scales mixed together in one area; they tend to be the same scale within a region.

It's misleading to think that one cell encodes only one space. These cells are reused, and in larger environments, they can be active in multiple places and in other environments. Nothing in the brain is a single "grandmother cell," and that's true here as well. At certain scales and in certain environments, it may look like one cell responds to one location, but that's not the whole story.

Place cells were discovered in 1971. If we follow the idea that their activity is at least somewhat independent of sensory inputs and generated by the brain, the next question is: where are these place cells, and how are they generated? The original place cell was recorded in CA1 of the hippocampus. Their graduate advisor, I believe, was Per Andersen, who worked on understanding the hippocampal and entorhinal cortex circuitry. There is a simplified version of this circuit, though it's not the entire picture.

Basically, there's some EC sensorimotor point cortex, layer two, layer three, CA1, CA3, and DG for dentate gyrus. If you look at a very simplified neuron in the entorhinal cortex from layer three, there's a soma that projects its axon. There's a simplified arrow, and the CA1 kind of captures it. So there's this column monosynaptic pathway, meaning there's only one synapse associated with it. There are other pathways where layer two in the cortex projects to the dentate gyrus, the green dentate gyrus projects to CA3, and CA3 projects to CA1. We don't need to go into this, but basically, there are a couple of monosynaptic or trisynaptic circuits where CA1 can be influenced from EC. I think this is established, but now we're finding more connections to this.

The idea was, at that time, if we want to know where place cells are generated, let's look one synapse upstream at the entorhinal cortex and do the same experiment. We're going to use six electrodes and see what we find. It's interesting that the way apical dendrites are arranged in the hippocampal complex, it's almost like an inside-out cortical layer. Layer one is at the bottom, and the pyramidal projection from layer six is superficial. It's interesting in terms of thinking about potential evolution. At this point, everything is flipped on top of each other—up and down doesn't make sense anymore.

The soma is mostly in what they call layer two or three, so it's superficial, closest to the edge of the structure.

At this point, it's all topsy-turvy, so what's up and what's down doesn't make much difference. The neocortical sheet comes around the side of the brain, wraps up into the middle, and stops being classic neocortex, becoming something else. The first thing is the entorhinal cortex, which is no longer six layers—they made up some number of layers—and then it wraps into CA1, then wraps around underneath. So what's top and what's bottom is meaningless at this point. One theory proposed a long time ago, though I'm not sure if it's true, is that this circuitry, where you have these three-layer tissues wrapping on top of one another, could have evolved into the six-layer cortex. You can imagine this is how it started, and the basic properties we assume in the cortical column are all here, plus some other features. Evolution just extended it out, and it became a six-layer cortex. The circuitry diagrams of the hippocampal complex are confusing and hard to interpret, and different researchers say different things. I've generally come to say not to worry about it too much. The basic connectivity is important, but what layers are labeled one, two, and three are kind of meaningless at this point.

Continuing on, doing the same experiment where the electrodes are stuck in, we can trace where the mouse has been with the gray lines and the black for that one particular grid cell, where it fired. The surprising finding was that this seems to be firing in a triangular or lattice-like pattern—grid cells. I'm going to go over a few characteristics of grid cells that are commonly used in papers.

Sometimes we talk about phase. I want to make sure everyone understands this because the basics can be confusing when we see this pattern. This is a single cell firing in multiple locations in an environment, whereas a place cell fires in one location in an environment.

The basic idea is that this is one cell we're looking at. In every location in the environment, there will be different grid cells or different place cells firing, so there's always some activity. Uniquely, grid cells do not represent a specific location; they represent multiple locations and are not a very good indicator of location. In this specific figure, the red, green, and blue are different cells, right? Yes, there are two cells. Are you going to explain this? You're welcome to take over too.

In this case, these are two grid cells: a green grid cell and a blue grid cell. In the same environment, the same kind of periodic pattern exists, except one is just shifted from the other. This is not an absolute measure; it's a relative measure to another grid cell. Scale refers to the spacing between the center of the firing fields. The spacing and orientation of the grid cells are shown relative to each other. If the green one is aligned vertically, the blue is rotated slightly, about 10 or 15 degrees. Usually, orientation is measured with respect to a reference, often a wall, and these experiments are often done in boxy environments. This is changing for reasons I'll discuss later.

On the left picture, we're showing two cells at different phases. These cells would be right next to each other, and a set of them would cover the entire environment. That is a grid cell module. A grid cell module is a set of grid cells that all have the same scale and orientation but different phases. In the middle example, if we have different scales, these are two different grid cell modules. Grid cell module A may have one scale, and module B may have another, and they are typically arranged linearly, forming larger and larger scales. When a grid cell module anchors on an environment, it has an orientation relative to the room. Two grid cell modules can have different orientations relative to the room. Any grid cell module could orient itself vertically in one room and diagonally in another. On the left, we're looking at properties of cells within one grid cell module; on the right, we're looking at properties of cells in two different grid cell modules.

Cells in a grid cell module are generally next to each other in the brain. There's a famous picture from the "tank paper" that shows exactly how these cells are aligned, proving that adjacent cells are literally adjacent in a grid cell module, just like in the figure.

Another common measure in the literature is the "gridness score" or "gs." You'll see this in some of the figures I screen captured. It measures how grid-like the cells are. To calculate this, once they get the firing field, they mask out the portion using a hexagon, mask out everything else, and mask out the middle portion, then rotate it by 30, 60, or 90 degrees and calculate the correlation between the rotated version and the original. If it's a regular grid-like pattern, you'll have a high correlation score. If it's not well correlated, the score will be low. The difference between the two is the grid score. In a very grid-like cell, this score will be high because after a 60-degree rotation, the correlation is high, while at 30 degrees, it's very negative, so the difference is large. In less grid-like cells, the gridness score is much smaller.

When I was reading one of the original papers, I wondered how they determined which cells were grid cells. It's a functional characteristic, not morphological. They measure firing rates after placing the electrode, and if the grid score is above a certain threshold, the cell is characterized as a grid cell. The threshold varies by paper, but in the original, any cell with a grid score of 0.2 or higher was considered a grid cell; others were rejected. It's more complicated and interesting than that. When they first started looking, as you pointed out, they were trying to find the predecessor or precursor to a place cell. They looked in the hippocampus; the O'Keefe lab looked there first but didn't find grid cells because the grid cell modules were too large in scale. They couldn't find cells that responded to the small environment. Then, by chance, another group picked a part of the entorhinal cortex where the grid cell modules were smaller in scale and found grid cells.

Once they found this grid-like property, they looked for cells that were really grid-like. They found grid cells, but there are many cells in the entorhinal cortex that are not classic grid cells.

They might be directly sensitive, so the cells respond when the animal is moving in a direction, but there's still some grittiness to them. You could have a cell that is directly sensitive but also spikes in a periodic location along some dimension. That's not a classic grid cell, because classic grid cells are independent of movement and direction—they just indicate location. Now they've found all these different types of cells in the entorhinal cortex, dozens of different ones that are not classic grid cells. You can assign a grid score to each one, indicating how much grittiness it has. The classic grid cells, when found, are very clearly grid-like. This approach allows not just identifying grid cells, but also recognizing other cells that share some properties with grid cells.

To go back to the earlier question about whether these cells are next to each other, as in two cells being connected, I don't know if it's that close just by eye. They're close enough that they're in proximity, but not necessarily immediately adjacent. We can look at the Tank paper later for more detail. Within a grid cell module, the cells are laid out like a map, but not immediately adjacent to each other. I can show you that picture later if you want to see it.

By the way, many of these other cells—scientists might find grid cells, but maybe only 10% of the cells are grid cells and 90% are not. They don't know what those other cells are, so they don't report on them, but sometimes say they have grittiness.

Another question is what percent of cells in the entorhinal cortex are grid cells. I'm not exactly sure. When Hubel and Wiesel did their first experiments on cats, they reported edge detectors and so on, but that was less than half the cells; more than half, they had no idea what they were doing. They would say, "These cells seem to be wonky, these spikes every once in a while, we don't know why," or "These cells seem to be silent." The same thing happens here—they find cells that are gritty, and then say, "Here's one with some grid properties."

It's an interesting concept. I would think you would find something that might be grid cells first and then measure the properties, but it's backwards in some sense. Some of these properties can vary. Jeff mentioned that scale varies by anatomical organization. As you go from dorsal to ventral in the entorhinal cortex—whatever dorsal and ventral mean in this context—it's relative to the head, like a dorsal fin on a shark, towards the top of the head. For mice, it's consistent, but for humans, the definition flips as you go from brain to spinal cord. It's a little bit confusing, but it's only important if you're actually cutting into the animal and trying to find this stuff.

Within the anatomical region, grid cells have a small scale that increases as you go ventral. Most people agree that this scaling is a geometric progression. I think that Moser reported a ratio of about 0.42, which is the square root of two, meaning the area increases by a factor of two for every module. Others report ratios between 1.3 and 1.7. When we say "cell module," this is not a continuous change; you go from one module at one scale, then it jumps to the next one.

I think this bullet point is incorrect. There are many opinions on how many modules actually exist in the animal. One source said four to five, but other papers have suggested up to ten. The general consensus is somewhere between three to ten. This is an important number. We don't know exactly why it's important, but if we want to get unique representations, some people have proposed—and we included it in our frameworks paper—that if each of these grid cell modules anchors independently, then the combination of which cells are active in each grid cell module becomes unique. This is where the idea of unique locations comes from. 

Mathematically, to get a unique location as we would like from a theory point of view, you need more than three to five modules. You want at least twenty. Also, you wouldn't want them at very different scales, because in a small environment, the big scale doesn't provide useful information. This remains a problem: to form unique representations of space, you need more than three to five or even ten modules. I'll propose later how this might be occurring. We were excited about the idea that you can combine a bunch of grid cell modules and get a unique location, even though each grid cell module is not unique. However, the numbers never really worked out well for us. I have a potential solution to that, which might be worth commenting on.

It's worth noting that orientation can also contribute to this—orientation differences and coding differences. With shifts in phase, orientation, or scale, you can get interferences where different grid cells fire at one particular location but don't co-align or interfere at other locations. That's what gives you the unique readout of a location. A single grid cell or even an entire grid cell module cannot uniquely define a location. We've discussed that you could have multiple grid cell modules at the same scale as long as they have different orientations and different anchoring, as Neil pointed out. But then you'd need a bunch, and I couldn't find evidence of many grid cell modules stacked at the same scale. That was a problem too.

We keep saying "unique," but what does that mean? Millions, billions, trillions? Let's do the math. If a grid cell module represents one-tenth of the area of an environment, then for a single grid cell module, you can only know where you are one-tenth of the time. It's not unique because the cells fire repeatedly in different places. If you have two grid cell modules that are not exactly the same, then it's ten times ten, so you could represent a hundred unique combinations. It's ten to the nth power: with twenty grid cell modules, it's ten to the twentieth, which is a very big number. That's sufficient, but ten to the third or ten to the fifth is probably not. You'd want a whole bunch of these so the combination is unique, avoiding false positives and negatives. Does that help answer the question?

You look confused. I was just running some numbers. Is ten to the seventh enough, or do you need ten to the twentieth? I don't know what's enough. Maybe that's what I was asking. There's math showing you can have five grid modules that give you twenty-one million unique codes. How do you get that? The phases have to be co-prime, like 3, 4, 5, 7, 11, so they align perfectly. In grid cells and neurons, there isn't coding like in computers. If I have a bunch of neurons and nine are the same and one is different, that's not unique. These are sparse distributed representations, so you can't just say one difference gives you a large number. In computers, every bit makes a big difference, so it's two to the n bits for representations. Here, the cell combinations have to be fairly unique, which is what you get with sparse distributed representations. The dimension of uniqueness I'm talking about is the phase. As long as the phases are co-prime, five different modules with five different phases that don't overlap—that are co-prime—make it rare for them to align. A grid cell module doesn't have a phase; the cells within the grid cell module have a phase.

The cells within the grid cell modules, if those are co-prime and you have five of them, you can get 21 million separate locations. I think that's Jeff's point: all the cells in a grid cell module have the same phase, so there's no interference between them. They'll always fire at different times, consistently. I might say something a little different on the slide, which is that within modules, the grid map is a universal IU scale, with orientation and phase relationships preserved across environments. I think the cells within a module have the same scale, orientation, and phase, but in a different environment, the whole grid cell module can be rotated differently. Within a module, there's a rigid relationship between the cells, but there are cells of different phases. For example, the orange is slightly translated from the blue in this picture. Within a module, the orientations are the same—it's a little hard to tell, but at least the phases are different. These are all the same module. In the same module, three cells are nearby each other. All cells within a module have the same orientation and the same scale, always. There's no change in that. The phases just represent that this cell responds to this area, and the next one responds to a different area. The frequency, which is basically the scale, is the same. 

Maybe it's worth going back to your comment, Tristan, that these are grid cells in the entorhinal cortex. We don't know if the exact same properties exist in whatever is giving us location path integration in cortical columns. Maybe that is more of a code based on different phases that then interfere, but I don't think so. I think it's extremely unlikely. I'll state that it's possible, but I don't think so. Jeff is going to go into more detail about this. 

Tristan was referring to a visualization where you have grid cells from one module with the same spacing but different phases. It's only at this location where all five wire together, while in other locations only two or three might do so, and that might be how location is encoded. These are different grid cell modules, not cells in the same module. These are different modules because they have the same spacing and orientation but different phases. If they didn't have the same orientation, you wouldn't get this pattern. This is a very confusing field.

What they're showing here is that a bunch of grid cell modules are firing at the same location. Those grid cells are in different modules, and the different colored cells are in different modules with different scales and orientations. Even though each module is not very unique and cannot tell you in much detail where you are, if you look at the combination of modules at any point in time, only one cell in each module will be active. That combination is pretty unique. These have to be in different modules, as I understand it.

You only need five modules to generate 21 million unique spots where they all align. I don't see that. I don't know how you get that number, Tristan. I don't think that's right. I'm not sure what math you're using. If we're saying there's 10, then mathematically it's possible for 10 modules to refer to something, but I don't think 10 is sufficient, and 10 doesn't get you those kinds of numbers.

I think this is showing something different, like the core idea behind how different grid cell modules work. These have the same spacing and scale. It's debatable whether they have different phases, because at one point they're all aligned, so in that sense they're in the same phase, but they have different orientations, which gives them only one point of interference. If they had different spacings, then within a module—or within a cortical column—that could maybe do something like that, but it's not really the phase; it's more the spacing or the orientation that needs to differ. Those are the two things that give you uniqueness, because the phase is what tiles space, and they have to have different phases; otherwise, you'll have gaps where no neuron fires.

Here's another way to look at this. I'm not addressing your question directly, Tristan. We can try to figure that out later. What grid cells give you—the important thing they give you—is not a unique location, but the ability to do path integration. That's a property we mentioned before: animals in the dark, as they move, the grid cells fire correctly in sequence. For that to work mechanistically, there has to be some sort of repetitive structure to them. You get this ability to provide a movement vector; the animal moves in some direction, and the grid cells in a module change—an adjacent one becomes active, then another, and then they repeat over and over. This regular tiling of space is essential for path integration. The mechanism wouldn't work if, within a grid cell module, all the cells didn't have the same spacing and orientation, separated only in phase—meaning one fires here, the next fires there as you move through space, and then they repeat.

The property of this grid being a triangular lattice is essential for the mechanism to work. We can't get away from that.

We can encode or do whatever we want mathematically, but we can't change that. Within a grid cell module, all the cells have the same spacing, are arranged with the same orientation, and are just shifted in phase. You take the lattice that one cell responds to, shift it over, and that's the next cell, and so on.

We probably need a paper to actually find that. We would solve this uniqueness problem if we only allowed the scale to be different across modules, but allowed for phase or orientation to be different within a module. Uniqueness requires multiple grid cell modules, and those modules must differ in either scale or orientation.

On any particular environment, when they remap, the orientation and which cell is active in which environment changes. They have to remap. It's the same grid cell modules, but they remap randomly. I don't know how to describe it better; it's very hard. My original question was: do you have an intuition for what is unique enough? You said 10 to the 20 is unique enough, but maybe 10 to the 10 isn't. Is it somewhere in there? I don't know, for our needs. It's a great question. What we want in our learning modules in Monty, which is the equivalent of a cortical column, is that there's a representation of location in layer six, and that has to be unique enough so that you don't confuse that location for another location in other objects or on the same object. What is that? It depends on how many objects I've learned and my tolerance for mistakes or false positives. I don't have an answer to that, other than you want it to be pretty unique. You don't want mistakes.

I actually posted about this on Discourse today because someone was asking about a paper where Marcus Lewis was first author in 2019. There's a fairly extensive analysis of how, as you vary the parameters—like the number of grid cell modules and how many cells are in each module—you get a change in the capacity to learn different objects before they start interfering and causing the system to fail. If you're interested, Tristan, I can link you to that. It goes into more detail.

Here's another interesting thing: when an animal first appears in an environment and doesn't know it, or doesn't recognize it, maybe it just hasn't gotten enough information to know where it is. The grid cells anchor in one way, and I think it's more of a generic way. I'm not a hundred percent certain about this, but a couple of things happen: the grid cell modules seem to expand their scale a little bit, and they also anchor in a way that's not unique. It's more like a generic room—okay, this is a generic rectangle. But if I recognize, "Oh, this is the particular rectangular room with the food in this corner, the toy in that corner, and the window over here," then they re-anchor to form a unique representation. So there's this non-unique default anchoring, like generic space, and then it becomes, "Oh, I know what it is, it's this particular one." 

Is that non-unique re-anchoring with respect to the body? Is it egocentric? No, it's always allocentric, always with respect to the environment. It has to be with respect to some objects. It could be random; it could be the default.

I see your point, Ramy. I don't know if there are any experiments where you put the rat in a featureless void. I'm not sure we've found a paper that explores this, but it would be interesting. In general, the animal knows what environment it is in right away. It knows it's in a rectangle; it may not know which rectangle or which box, but normally, I think this is deliberate—they don't obscure information in the room. There will be unique things on the ceiling and so on, and that's just considered part of it; the animal knows it's in that room. But I think there have been experiments where, when the animal doesn't know what room it's in, it forms one representation, but when it knows, it anchors and then it knows. 

One interesting thing about these experiments: typically, the rat is in a maze or a box, and the top of the box is open.

And if you looked up, you'd see the room of the experimenters, the labs, and sometimes even the experimenters themselves hovering over. The rat would see them, but they ignore that and say, "Oh, this is a feature of this box." So the rat is in there, and we didn't put any features on the walls yet, so it has no way of knowing what room it's in. It has no input, which is questionable, because the animals can see the room above. There have been some experiments where they completely seal it off, and then you see this property where, I believe, it forms a sort of generic representation of space based on whether it's a box, rectangle, or circular environment. Then, when it becomes a particular circular or rectangular environment, it re-anchors.

That would be great if there were some studies. I'm curious, Hojae, just to preview what's to come next. Did you come across anything like that in the limited time you had to look? You mean like the wall being covered or not, or an experimental setup where the animal would be unsure what room it is, and then they're measuring grid cells, and then it suddenly recognizes that it's different? I feel like often they're focused on place cells and place cell reorientation. I don't know if they specifically look at what the grid cells are doing. I'm pretty sure if we asked Marcus, they would remember. The whole idea of re-anchoring is, I remember they would take a room and hide it. The room would be identical until they put a white placard on one wall, and then the animal would re-anchor to that white pocket, or they put a red pocket on the other wall, and the animal would re-anchor differently. So there is this sort of anchoring based on visual clues that tell the animal which is which. If they color one side of the room differently from the other, that can cause re-anchoring.

Another thing related to unfamiliar environments is that oftentimes they say, "Okay, we waited four days until the animal got familiar with the environment and then measured the grid cell activity." This is a slide that I didn't add in. Another property that I didn't add here is field size. Basically, the size of the circle is another kind of property that is sometimes special but not often explored enough. That is, what's the radius or diameter of the firing field? What they found is that in unfamiliar environments, the field size would temporarily increase. If you pick a mouse and go somewhere, the field size will temporarily increase and then over time it will decrease. If the field size is decreasing, that means that if there's enough grid cells, the resolution of a location is getting higher, and the number of unique locations that we can identify gets higher. I'm not sure if that's true, because the number of grid cells hasn't changed. Imagine these grid cells perfectly tile the space, so every place in the environment, at least one of the grid cells is firing. If you made the grid cells' fields larger or smaller—if you made them smaller, then there would be spaces in the environment that wouldn't respond at all. With making them larger, you're just introducing uncertainty. You're just saying, "I'm not sure if I'm here or here," but it doesn't increase the resolution of the environment. That's dictated by the number of grid cells there are.

If you don't increase the number of grid cells, then you can't encode more space or have more locations. Maybe not resolution, but certainty. You might think you're in multiple locations, like multiple hypotheses to use Monty terminology, while the field sizes are large. As they narrow, those hypotheses collapse into a smaller number or one. Another thing they showed: remember I mentioned earlier, the animals in the dark, the grid cells do the path integration. You can experience this yourself—if you're really in the dark and you start moving, you get more and more uncertain as to where you are as you move. If you then find a clue, like if I'm in the dark and I touch a corner of a wall in my room, I know where I am, then you're exactly anchored again in space. I speculate, as you path integrate and you don't have any visual or other clues to tell you where you are, those firing fields will get larger. You're passing, but you don't really know where you are anymore—some blobby area. Then you get a clue, and they narrow down again. That's how I've always suspected that happens. I don't have any evidence, but that's what it feels like.

My phone just beeped, but it's been one hour. I'm only one third of the way through. Let me see if I can pick up again. I went over this slide. Grid cells know the animals. This is a simple one, and I wanted to put one of the most important ideas of where TP came from. Grid cells are found in mouse, rat, macaque, and human—human only by fMRI, because you can't just poke an electrode in, as this is not recommended. This might seem random, but that's actually because they wanted to see how there's grid cell activity in animals that navigate naturally in 3D space by flying.

The main idea we had, probably Josh's statement honestly, is that we're combining two types of experiments. One is by fMRI, where we have some evidence that there are grid cells in the human entorhinal cortex. Another paper suggests there seems to be grid-like activity in the cortex of mice. Combining these, it's not a stretch to say there could be grid cell-like activity in spinal sensory or other cortical areas of humans. I think that's all true, but that's not how it came about, Hojae. We logically deduced that cortical columns must have a representation of the location of sensorimotor input. We deduced that there has to be path integration—you move your finger and anticipate what you'll feel. We knew this had to happen locally, at every patch of your skin. It's not clear that it has to happen locally in the visual cortex, but we said yes, it does. Then we asked, how could a cortical column represent a location with path integration? At first, we had no idea how neurons could do this. But then we realized that grid cells do something similar. We studied grid cells and realized they are a complicated mechanism that does exactly what we want. So we guessed it's unlikely that cortex evolution came up with a different mechanism to do the same thing it was already doing in the entorhinal cortex. It's much more likely it took the same mechanism and repurposed it in the cortex. It was pure speculation—we didn't know about the evidence for grid cells in the neocortex at the time. We guessed there would be grid-like mechanisms in the neocortex, in the lower layers, throughout the cortex. Later, we learned there was evidence for this, and it seemed a fairly safe bet. It's so complicated, and it's in the same cortical sheet, just further over in the same tissue. It's almost certain that whatever evolution discovered for the entorhinal cortex would be used in the cortex as well. Then we found evidence of that.

It's not that everything you said is untrue, just the order in which it happened. I went over this—by the way, these two pictures are from the ment HTM school. Someone created a Jupyter notebook where you could move your mouse over, and a tiny mouse would move over your screen, colored by circular grid cell firing fields. I couldn't find the actual GitHub repo, but I did find a YouTube video of it. I'm glad I put an asterisk—actually, the story may not be this simple in terms of how grid cells give rise to place fields or unique locations. The general idea proposed by the Mosers was that if you have results from different modules and stack them together, depending on how they overlap or interfere, that would give unique fields. But I feel it's a bit more complicated than that. There's also the question of whether it was the Mosers who did that—I thought someone else did, but I'll take your word for it. They may have done it.

Honestly, people's opinions are changing, even over the past ten years. It's hard to say. Some research in this field is very competitive, with many counterclaims and claims. It's a very dynamic field. I thought this was settled, like textbook knowledge, but it's not. We're debating a lot of things.

Jeff, this is my only mention of the word "oscillatory interference," which is one of a couple of models that tries to explain how grid cell firing fields are generated. The natural question is, if we take this hypothesis that combinations of grid fields can give rise to place fields, then where are these grid fields coming from? There are a couple of theories, and that's all I'll mention about it. 

Anyway, I'll get through this quickly so we can get to that part, or you can explain more. One could just ask, how do grid cells get this property? What makes them fire like this? There are two basic theories: one is called oscillatory interference, and one is called continuous attractor networks. I believe the right answer, as exposed in a paper, is that it's a combination of the two. I'll talk about that later. There are at least four videos on hybrid models of grid cells, oscillatory interference, and continuous attractor networks from about five years ago. There will be an update here as well.

Maybe this would be a good time to swap over to Jeff, for what you were going to present. Then we can see how much time is left for the rest of Hojae's part at the end. That works, since you were going to talk about how grid cells emerged. We could spend weeks going down the rabbit hole of grid cells—it's unbelievable. But I think I could step up a level to make it more applicable to Monty here. Sounds good. If you don't mind, maybe I can mention just one recent organization that may be interesting.

I think this 2022 paper was interesting because, instead of using the traditional approach, they used new Neuropixels electrodes to record the activity of grid cells within a module over time in mice. They measured about 500 to 1,000 cells simultaneously, so each time point produced a high-dimensional population vector. They used dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA and UMAP for visualization and found that the activity of these neurons from the same module seemed to form an "oid." I'm not entirely sure what an "oid" is—maybe it just describes the repeating nature of the activity—but the key point is that when they looked at grid cell firing in a regular box, they saw the expected hexagonal pattern, and a similar pattern appeared in a toy environment, indicated by black dots. When the mouse moved to a wheelbarrow-like 2D environment, the firing patterns changed due to the new environment, but in 3D, the pattern did not persist.

The most important part is that grid cells seem to represent locations in two-dimensional space. The natural question is whether they can represent three-dimensional spaces. Researchers have done a lot of work with bats flying in large environments, recording from these cells while the bat is flying. They found that grid cells still fired in particular locations, but in the third dimension, they lost their grid-like structure, became more random, and their size changed. The field is still uncertain about what happens in 3D.

This might relate to the concept of re-anchoring. There's a statement that grid cells form a metric space, which initially makes sense, but with re-anchoring, it's not really a global metric space. The fact that we can re-anchor in many ways means that, locally within a grid cell module, once it's anchored, it's metric. This means you can start anywhere, move in a certain direction, and get the same results, or perform path integration and return to your starting point. This regular structure is independent of re-anchoring; it's a property of the cells, not their position in the world.

I'm still sorting this out, but one striking thing is that these patterns can be stretched or compressed in different geometries. For example, in the hairpin maze, you still see some grid periodicity, but it's highly dependent on the environment's geometry. The 3D study was interesting because the authors suggested some environment geometry invariance, but they only tested two environments, and neither was truly natural. We should look at that paper to see its relevance to 3D space, which is important for Monty.

If grid cells are really 2D, and we have evidence that we learn two-dimensional maps even for three-dimensional objects, like faces or dice, it may not matter for Monty. We can use 3D or n-dimensional representations. The question is whether we need to do what neuroscience does, or if it's enough to have a consistent metric space locally for recognizing objects and making predictions. This fits with our experience during the TBP Olympics at the retreat: if you close your eyes and try to feel a huge object, path integration becomes noisy over long distances, but within a certain region, it's fine—you can tell that one feature is above or to the right of another.

That's the key point. Even if we re-anchor for a new object, we still get the integration of movement that we want.

I had this discussion with TP Monty about a month ago regarding the three streams in Monty: the behavioral stream, the morphological stream, and the feature stream. We're separating the features from the morphology, especially if these are recorded in a space different from the one we are observing. For example, we observe things in 3D in Habitat and assign them a location in 3D. This kind of representation adds an additional dimension, which might provide more representational power to encode something more generic, possibly a generic class of morphological model. The combination of the morphological model and the features gives a specific instance, such as a particular mug—a TP mug versus a Greek mug. We use this approach during the temporal memory mechanism, where we define minicolumns and the morphology of an object. This allows us to form unique representations of that morphological object, not by changing the location space, but by changing the encoding—the feature and location combination. These are complex topics and take a long time to absorb.
