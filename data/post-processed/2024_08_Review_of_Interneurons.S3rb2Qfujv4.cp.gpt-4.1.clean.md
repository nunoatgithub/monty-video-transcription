All right. We're reviewing the paper "Interneurons and the Neocortical Inhibitory System." I'll start with some background material and switch to my PowerPoint. When I began studying neuroscience, neurons were classified as either excitatory or inhibitory. For excitatory neurons, there are two types: pyramidal cells and spiny stellate cells. There's no question about these cells; everyone agrees they're present and consistent. The reason pyramidal cells and spiny stellate cells are grouped together is that both have an excitatory effect on their postsynaptic cells. If they form a synapse on another cell, they excite that cell. These synapses are all spiny, meaning they have spines, and they only form on dendrites. It's generally assumed that learning occurs at these spiny synapses, whether by changing their effectiveness or by growing new ones.

For inhibitory neurons, the situation is more complex. The term "spiny" refers to the spine, which is a small protrusion on the dendrite where the synapse forms. "Bouton" is another word for spine. Excitatory synapses are almost all on spines, so the axon and dendrite don't directly connect; instead, a spine grows out of the dendrite and forms the connection. Early researchers like Cajal would see these spines as little bumps on the dendrites and called them spiny neurons or spiny synapses.

In contrast, inhibitory neurons come in many types: large basket cells, small basket cells, chandelier cells, double bouquet cells, Martinotti cells. Most of these names come from early anatomical descriptions based on cell appearance, not function. For example, pyramidal cells are named for their pyramid-shaped cell bodies, and spiny stellate cells look like stars and have spiny synapses. These inhibitory neurons all have an inhibitory effect, making the recipient cell less likely to fire. However, their classification and nomenclature are inconsistent, with different researchers using different terms for the same cells.

Inhibitory synapses are called aspiny. Under an electron microscope, you wouldn't see a spine; instead, there's just a slight spot on the dendrite where the axon connects. Inhibitory synapses can form on the soma (cell body), the axon hillock (the beginning of the axon), or the dendrites. Unlike excitatory synapses, which only form on dendrites, inhibitory synapses can be found in any of these three areas. It's generally assumed that inhibitory synapses are involved in regulation—such as enforcing sparsity, synchronization, rhythms, or operational states of the system—rather than memory. This remains the prevailing view.

Let's talk about pyramidal neurons. Only pyramidal neurons have apical dendrites—these are the large dendrites that extend toward the top layer of the cortex. Pyramidal cells, and only pyramidal cells, send a branch of their axon outside of the column. All cells form many synapses locally within their column, but pyramidal neurons always send an axon that leaves the cortex and goes elsewhere. Stellate cells, specifically spiny stellate cells, look similar to pyramidal cells but lack the apical dendrite and the long-range axon, so they form similar local connections.

There was at least one paper we read that argued stellate cells are essentially pyramidal cells without an apical dendrite, but otherwise operate the same. At some point, it was discovered that some inhibitory neurons are not always inhibitory and can act in an excitatory fashion under certain conditions, so the nomenclature changed. The new nomenclature is pyramidal neurons and interneurons. Interneurons are defined as neurons that don't send their axon outside of the local column. Spiny stellate cells have been moved into the interneuron category, which is confusing because they're more like pyramidal neurons, but this is the nomenclature that has been settled on.

This can be confusing, but you can see it in the paper we're about to review. I want to show you this picture to make sure we're all on the same page. This is a pyramidal neuron. The picture appears to be part photomicrograph and part hand-drawn. The pyramidal cell has a triangular cell body, which is why it's called pyramidal. These are the basal dendrites, with many synapses on them. This is the apical dendrite, and this upper part is called the tuft. Most pyramidal neurons don't have the small offshoots called Schaefer collaterals—only some do, but most don't. This is the axon hillock. The axon also branches and connects to other nearby cells, though that's not shown here. The axon hillock is the very initial segment of the axon. When a cell spikes, the soma gets depolarized. Normally, it's at a resting potential of about minus 70 millivolts. When depolarized, the voltage increases, and if it exceeds a certain threshold, the cell spikes. The depolarization occurs here, but the action potential starts at the axon hillock.

There are chandelier cells that form synapses right on the axon hillock, which have a significant effect on whether the cell sends a spike down its axon. This isn't mentioned in the paper we're reviewing, but I've wondered about it, and we have some new data. It probably wouldn't prevent the cell from sending a back action potential up its dendrites, since it's just stopping the action potential from going down the axon. There are synapses on the cell body—some of the small bumps are inhibitory synapses. You never find excitatory synapses on the cell body; those are only along the dendrites. There are inhibitory synapses on the axon hillock, on the cell body, and some spread along the dendrites. It's a small percentage, but they are present.

These different types of inhibition likely have different effects. The ones along the dendrites probably change the threshold for generating a dendritic spike. If not enough cells are active, changing inhibition out here could lead to more NMDA spikes. Inhibition on the cell body would effectively shut down all activity of the cell, which could help create sparsity. Inhibitory synapses can do various things. One recent finding is that synapses on the axon hillock might help synchronize cells.

The diagram shows a chandelier cell, which forms a row of synapses on many pyramidal cells. They're called chandelier cells because, when stained, the synapses look like candles on a chandelier. There's also a double bouquet cell, which has a narrow axon and a large, bushy string of axon associated with many columns. The large basket cell inhibits many other cells, primarily by inhibiting the somas. This gives a sense of the types of cells we're discussing.

Here's the paper Romney found and I read earlier, which I agreed to review. The title is "Interneurons of the Neocortical Inhibitory System." They're making a distinction by leaving out spiny stellate cells and focusing only on inhibitory cells. The term "interneurons" is no longer a good term for inhibitory cells. The highlighted line at the end of the abstract says, "This review focused on organizing principles that govern the diversity of inhibitory interneurons and their circuits." They'll mostly leave out spiny stellate cells, even though those are interneurons, because they're not inhibitory.Most people have no idea what the circuits in the cortex are doing. We have many ideas about this, but most people don't. Many scientists try to find ways to characterize cells, and this paper explores various methods to examine and classify inhibitory interneurons. The classification is quite complex, and much of it is not very useful, at least in my opinion. However, that's the focus of this paper: discussing inhibitory interneurons and the different ways to organize, classify, and describe their functions.

This line here is a standard statement you'll see everywhere: in the neocortex, 70 to 80 percent of the cells are excitatory pyramidal neurons, also called spiny stellate cells, which are smaller in number. They have relatively stereotyped anatomical, physiological, and molecular properties. As I said earlier, pyramidal cells are very similar. The remaining 20 to 30 percent of neocortical neurons are interneurons, mostly inhibitory, which have diverse morphological, physiological, molecular, and synaptic characteristics. They're really different, all over the map, and that's what they're going to discuss here.

This highlighted text says interneurons can also be excitatory. The spiny stellate cell is an important type.

They're saying this is another interneuron, but for the most part, they don't discuss it further in the paper because it's not inhibitory. They mention these cells are found only in layer four, specifically in primary sensory areas. That was the original understanding, but I think they're found elsewhere now, so I'm not sure if that's still accurate. They also state that spiny stellate cells have a partial apical-like dendrite that can reach layer three, which I haven't heard before. I know their dendrites spread around, but I've never heard of a partial apical-like dendrite, and I didn't see a reference for that.

The first figure is a cartoonish drawing of different cell types, illustrating anatomical diversity. The cells don't actually look like this, but they included the spiny stellate cell, which is excitatory. They also mention cells that target the soma and proximal dendrites, forming inhibitory synapses on the cell body and proximal dendrites. This category mostly includes basket cells—large and small basket cells are common, but they introduce the "nest basket cell" here, which I haven't heard of before. Other scientists might not include the nest basket cell and may classify it as large or small, so the classification is somewhat arbitrary.

They also describe cells that target only the dendrites, such as double bouquet cells and bipolar cells. Double bouquet cells are also considered bipolar cells by some. There's also the Martinotti cell, which primarily targets layer one apical dendrites and spreads widely in layer one. This is relevant because there's a lot of activity spread in layer one, as discussed in the paper we're writing. The Martinotti cell is inhibitory and seems to inhibit dendrites in layer one. The chandelier cell forms cassettes of multiple synapses on the axon hillock and terminal cells.

They're providing an overview before going into details. Soma-targeting cells are expected to have a higher inhibitory effect than dendrite-targeting cells, but the effects are different. Inhibiting the soma prevents the cell from firing, while an inhibitory synapse on a dendrite reduces the chance of generating a dendritic spike. In our theory, dendritic spikes are like predictions; inhibiting the dendrite doesn't prevent firing but makes it harder or easier for the dendrite to generate a spike.

I've always imagined there's a threshold on dendrites—if 15 to 20 synapses are active in a small area (about 40 microns) at the same time, a dendritic spike is generated. If inhibitory synapses are dispersed along the dendrite, their activity can change the threshold, maybe from 15–20 to 20–25, or 10–15. If too many cells are becoming active, or if there's not enough predictive activity, you could change the threshold and loosen things up. For example, when you see a shape in a cloud and interpret it as a dog, you might be lowering the threshold on the dendrites, allowing for a match with less evidence.

I'm not going to go through most of this paper because it's quite detailed. The question was about double bouquet cells—computationally, we sometimes talk about them as excitatory neurons, especially in defining receptive fields. Is it about inhibition of inhibition? I've learned to ignore those ideas because double bouquet cells may have a background firing rate that's reduced, maintaining a constant threshold of inhibition, or there could be double inhibition. It's complicated and difficult to track, so I stopped worrying about it.

Is the data available on the background firing rates of double bouquet cells, and how does it change with attention? There are so many variables in real-life scenarios that it's hard to get the data you'd like. 

There's another figure showing the propensity of different cells in different layers. There's a lot of data, but it's hard to interpret directly. Once you have a theory, you can look at data like this to see if it supports or contradicts the theory. For example, in layer six, there are more small basket cells than in any other layer. The general idea for small basket cells is...I believe, and others have suggested, that small basket cells are generally there to create sparsity, ensuring that not too many cells are firing. The small ones are more limited in area, possibly within a column, while the large ones seem to extend beyond, providing column-to-column inhibition as well. So, with small basket cells, you might have higher sparsity in these regions. I don't know.

I'm not going to go through each cell. This one here is the double bouquet cell, which we've been discussing a lot.

These words all describe what we've been talking about. They have a bitufted morphology, meaning the dendrites extend in both directions, up and down. We're talking about the dendritic morphology, not the axons. Their special feature is a tight axonal cylinder—the axon is really tight and narrow. I'm not sure what fasciscular means; I think it refers to being highly branching or something similar. It resembles a horsetail, and sometimes these are called horsetail cells in early literature.

They discuss some of the details.

It says these cells are interleaved with pyramidal cells and inhibit their basal dendrites.

This is just language to describe what the cells look like. Then we get into things like neuropeptides and proteins used to categorize these cells. I'm not exactly sure how they categorize them, but they list three calcium-binding proteins and four neuropeptides associated with different cell types. On the right, there are different types of firing patterns—they characterize the spike patterns. For example, adapting, non-adapting, stuttering, and so on. IS stands for irregular spiking. They make up names for these different patterns. You can associate the cell with the neuropeptide and the different spike patterns. I have no idea what to do with that information; it's there, but it's unclear how to use it.

There's an interesting highlighted section about the electrical properties of neurons. Originally, all inhibitory neurons were described as fast spiking. This means two things: how quickly they generate the first spike and how fast the spikes occur, but the more important aspect is how quickly they generate the first spike. Our temporal memory theory requires that when a pyramidal cell becomes active, it inhibits all its neighbors. If the pyramidal cell activates an inhibitory neuron, it then has to activate all the other cells before they can spike. This system has to work very fast. Someone simulated this for us and confirmed that it could work. That's an important part of our theory.

The paper discusses different response properties of these cells. Unfortunately, these properties are almost always detected in slice preparations, where the brain is removed from the animal, sliced, and kept in liquid to keep it somewhat alive. There are two ways they do this: steady-state response types, where they inject current continuously into the soma, and the cell doesn't get to relax, so they observe what kind of spikes it generates; and step depolarization, which is the onset response type, where they look at the initial pulse of current. They can classify cells based on these responses.

Before I go on, there's another figure showing the number of synapses individual interneurons make on pyramidal cells. This value is very hard to interpret in any meaningful way.

Then they say, we're looking at these response types, like a pulse—how does it respond to a pulse, and how does it respond to current injection? They mention that while this is a useful means, maybe these types aren't really real. Extrapolating these in vivo, meaning what would actually happen in a live animal, is hard to say because the brain is sliced and perfused with artificial fluid. We see a different synaptic environment, and the cells are subject to neuromodulator control, which could profoundly change their discharge properties. Basically, they're saying the way we characterize these cells may not be accurate in a live animal. It's not that it's not useful, but you have to remember these things aren't set in stone.

They talk about ion channel composition—these are the channels along the cell membrane, and interneurons can be parsed by different types of ion channels. Again, it's not really easy to interpret in any revealing way. They can also look at genetic expressions and gene clusters, but it's not really worth going into all that. These are different cell response properties, based on steady-state response to sustained current injection in the soma. They inject current into the cell, and some cells behave differently—some have a series of spikes, some don't, some have a little burst in between. They put names on these things, trying to sort them into classifications, which isn't unreasonable, but it's very difficult to interpret.

What's the point of this? One thing we've learned, and something Sherman and others have proposed, is that most pyramidal neurons and most cells generally don't burst very often; they have steady-state spiking. When you have a little burst, like these here, or at the beginning of this one—a burst of spikes right in a row—when this reaches the destination neuron, those bursts can cause metabolic changes. They can cause the receiving cell to grow or change physically, express genes, and make things happen that aren't just voltage depolarization. So these bursts really do matter, but it's very complex and hard to say exactly how.

I'm not going to go through most of this. Here's another take on the same things: different cell types, different spiking patterns. I'm not actually sure.

This is according to discharge responses at steady state and onset phase. I think this is like the pulse version of the one I showed earlier. Again, you look at this and wonder what to do with this information. I didn't know what to do.

They talk about interneurons themselves—even though they're mostly inhibitory, they get excitatory synapses. There's some interesting clues here. They're talking about delays, and they say this might cause targeted inhibitory cells deep in cortical layers to join before those in the supergranular layers. This is the kind of thing I pick up on—they're basically saying there are properties that might make the upper layers go first and the lower layers go second, or vice versa. I just highlight things that catch my attention like that.

This is another chart—a correlation map between different ion channel genes and specific electrical parameters. If you were studying a disease related to various ion channels and wanted to know the genes expressing those channels, this might be useful. But from my point of view, for understanding how the brain works, it's not very useful. There's nothing bad about it; it's just not actionable for me.

This is interesting: there's a new idea that these inhibitory cells aren't always inhibitory. The same synapses can be inhibitory or excitatory under different conditions.

A single neocortical neuron can receive both depressing and facilitating GABAergic synapses. GABA is the inhibitory neurotransmitter.

If an interneuron has a delayed onset response, synapses tend to be depressing. If the onset response is classic or bursting, synapses tend to be facilitating. So now, some of these synapses can be inhibitory, and some can be excitatory.

Look at this orange one here.

Neurons that preferentially target axon initial segments are chandelier cells. These are involved in phasing and synchronizing neural activity. I used to think all inhibitory synapses would just prevent a cell from firing, but that may be misleading. It might be more accurate to say they change the timing of a spike, rather than simply causing or preventing it. For example, chandelier cells form synapses on the axon hillock. A paper I read showed that activation of chandelier cells shortly before the expected pyramidal neuron spike evoked reliable inhibition, but activation at earlier times could evoke hyperpolarization or depolarizing effects. If the chandelier cell fires right before the pyramidal cell is about to fire, it inhibits the pyramidal cell, but at other times it might make the cell more likely to fire. This is similar to timing-dependent plasticity, but here it’s about timing-dependent spike formation. Chandelier cells may change when the pyramidal cell generates a spike, possibly synchronizing pyramidal cell firing. For dendritic spikes to occur, action potentials must arrive within a millisecond or a few milliseconds, so chandelier cells may precisely control spike timing as a synchronization method.

Neurons that preferentially target initial segments, like chandelier cells, are involved in phasing and synchronizing neural activity. There are references for this idea in the paper.

There’s a chart mapping glutamate synapses from neocortical pyramidal neurons onto interneurons. It shows that pyramidal cells form excitatory synapses on different types of inhibitory cells, and the synaptic responses vary. I’m not sure what to do with that information.

The paper discusses balancing excitation and inhibition, asking why excitatory and inhibitory processes occur simultaneously. There’s no mention of sparsity or its advantages, or why inhibition is desirable. I don’t recall the paper explaining why you’d want to inhibit neurons, which I found amusing.

They mention different ways of classifying these cells, suggesting we might not be getting it right.

I highlighted a section with useful statistics: about 60% of the synapses on an AAL neuron in layers 2/3 are inhibitory, coming from about 70 interneurons, half being basket cells. Roughly 50 of these are neurons from the same layer. This could be useful for reference.

The conclusion is that there’s a common cortical circuit—a template neocortical microcircuit duplicated throughout the neocortex. This template is highly stereotypical, described as a generic microcircuit with subtle specializations for different brain regions. Each microcircuit at any location seems to support simultaneous processing of multiple features, though I’m not sure what that means. Overall, it’s a common microcircuit.

That’s my read on the paper. There hasn’t been much discussion, but let me know if you have any thoughts or questions.

I have one question. Somewhere in the paper, they mention differential synaptic transmission. I didn’t catch the exact term. Let me share my screen.

Your notes are probably better than mine.

They mention differential synaptic transmission, referring to short-term synaptic plasticity. My interpretation is that excitatory cells can route neurotransmitters to cause some dendrites to be more depressed or facilitated, usually lasting less than a second. This means excitatory cells can cause different dendrites to have different effects on the postsynaptic neuron. I didn’t know this before and I’m not sure if it’s correct. Can you scroll down so I can see the previous sentence? We’re in the category of interneurons, right? They say these synapses typically form clusters on a small fraction of the dendrites.

These are excitatory synapses on inhibitory cells. Instead of being spread out as required on pyramidal cells to recognize sparse patterns, they're grouped together, meaning this excitatory cell will activate this inhibitory cell. Unlike glutamatergic synapses on excitatory cells, glutamatergic synapses on inhibitory cells are different.

They often have frequency-dependent facilitation. These features are found in some interneurons and different types of therapeutic behavior. The glutamatergic system may have a functional dichotomy for recruiting parietal neurons and interneurons.

It's clearer if you look at the paragraph below. In hippocampal synapses from accessory cells on inhibitory neurons, the effect is inhibitory. The static, dynamic depression and facilitation across layers might target inhibitory cells, but these are depressing synapses, even though they come from excitatory cells. That's why they're called differential—it's different from what glutamate normally does. At first, I thought "differential" referred to a time difference, but they're just saying the same cell can have different effects on different membranes.

This goes back to the earlier comment that these were once thought to be purely inhibitory. Everyone assumed the same kind of synapses would result in the same effects, but that's not always the case. The way I interpret it, the same excitatory cell, when it spikes or makes an action potential, doesn't have the same effect on all its synapses. It can facilitate or depress some synapses, but those are just synapses on inhibitory neurons. I don't think that's true when a pyramidal cell connects to another pyramidal cell.

That was part of what I was considering. I would put this into the category: is this where learning occurs, or is it a regulatory function? As soon as you have synapses on inhibitory cells or interneurons, you're in the realm of regulatory function. Once you're in regulatory function, it's a wild zoo of unknown possibilities—anything can happen, and it almost seems like anything does happen. It's a very different story.

This is one of many things in this paper that are surprising. My take is that we started by ignoring inhibitory cells in our theories, except for the need for sparsity, because there's too much unknown and it doesn't seem to be where learning occurs. So we focused on how learning could occur within excitatory, pyramidal cells. When we need a regulatory function, we look into the mixed bag of things like in this paper to try to find it.

For example, how do grid cells work? That requires all kinds of unusual mechanisms, some of which involve shifting phases of certain cells, probably using interneurons, though no one really knows how that happens. If we need a system to do something, it's probably done by interneurons, and maybe we can figure out how.

The example I gave earlier was the basket cell supporting the idea of a burst of cells and a quickly winning cell in the temporal memory algorithm. That was the first time we needed an inhibitory cell to do something specific. Basket cells are well characterized, so we could check if they could do what we needed, and that was a positive experience. For most of these cells, we don't have that clarity.

Have we considered that maybe the double bouquet cells are responsible for inhibition across the column, like for lateral inhibition within a column? If one of the cells in the mini-column excites the double bouquet cell, it could be.

No, I don't think so, actually. I think the double bouquet cells are slow, if I recall. They're not very fast cells, and they wouldn't serve that purpose. I think that's the main reason—they're kind of slow.

There was an interesting question I had early on: the classic Hubel and Wiesel experiments show all these cells in a minicolumn have the same basic response properties. I always asked myself, how did that happen? What makes these cells have the same response properties? Most neuroscientists just assumed it was genetic. I always felt that couldn't be true, because they would argue that when an animal is born, it already has those response properties, but then there are these waves that go across the retina. It's complicated. But throughout the cortex, it's almost impossible that all those minicolumns have response properties that are genetically determined. So what forces these cells to have the same response properties?

Before I knew a lot about double bouquet cells, I thought there had to be some sort of interneuron enforcing that. There has to be some mechanism that forces these things to all have the same response property. I looked at double bouquet cells to see if they fit the bill. They're perfectly aligned with these minicolumns. At least they have the ability to control all the cells in the minicolumn in some way. We also said those double bouquet cells probably have to have the same response property as the cells in the minicolumn, and sure enough, they do. That was another prediction: they should respond, and they do. The double bouquet cells get input directly from the LGN or the retina, from the thalamus, and that all fit beautifully.

They're going to be defining what the minicolumn is. The template of the spatial pool algorithm would be between these double bouquet cells. They would somehow enforce all the cells in that minicolumn to have the same response property. Neil's objection, which is a good one, is that it seems to be inhibiting them. I don't know; we could figure that out later. But physically, it's the only thing that fits. Another interesting thing I read recently is that there seems to be just one double bouquet cell per minicolumn in the upper layer and the lower layer, which is really interesting because just that one cell is going to determine the response property as well as the 50 cells below it, or the 20 cells below it. These are the ways we work these things into the theory.

One thing I found interesting in this paper is that they talk about inhibition of inhibition. There's a whole section about inhibitory-on-inhibitory, and they say somewhere that the basket cells are more interconnected than double bouquet cells. The double bouquet cells don't really inhibit each other that much, but the basket cells do. I don't know what to make of that. If it's a spatial pool, there has to be some.

The way that the double bouquet cells do not all become active at once suggests they require some form of inhibition. When discussing increased inhibition in certain areas, it's important to note that this may be based solely on synapse counts, which is not ideal. A single strategically placed synapse can have a significant effect, while many non-strategically placed synapses may do very little or encode a specific pattern. It's necessary to examine such data carefully. These cells are more complex than I initially thought. That's why I categorize them under regulatory functions and revisit them as needed.

Recently, inspired by developments in the grid cell literature, I considered the idea that cells in a minicolumn might share response properties but differ in phase. This is a requirement for grid cells, and I haven't seen it discussed or tested before. It's possible that double bouquet cells not only assign the same response property to each cell but also enforce phase shifts along their axons, which are slow-conducting. This could create phase shifts as you move along the minicolumn. This is a new idea that has emerged in the last couple of years.

Double bouquet cells receive input from the thalamus, and in V1, most cells in layers 2, 3, and 4 respond to movement. Layer 4 contains more static-responsive cells, but many layer 3 cells are movement-sensitive. The current theory is that these cells perform path integration for object components, essentially tracking object behaviors. If this is true, there could be another set of path integration processes in layer three, such as detecting the movement of the top of a stapler and determining its position. This would require phase shifts in the upper layers, so perhaps layer three cells have phase shifts necessary for grid cells and path integration. There are many unknowns, and this is speculative, but it seems likely these elements will connect.

We know the cortex must learn object behaviors, and these cells are movement-sensitive, which likely reflects their function. Layer three cells detect movements over small areas, so the pieces fit together.

That was a great review. Thanks, Jeff. You wrote a lot of helpful notes. I wouldn't have chosen this paper if you hadn't suggested it, but it's a good opportunity to learn more neuroscience. I feel like I'm missing some background, so I wanted to pick a paper that would help. It was a good way to cover foundational neuroscience and discuss how the field has changed.

I enjoyed doing it.

Thanks for suggesting the paper, Rami. That's all I have. In the Slack channel, Rami, you posted some interesting notes about how this might relate to recent theory discussions. I think we've covered most of them. I purposely didn't read your notes because I wanted to see if my take was similar or different. I also skipped a lot of the ion-related content in the middle of the paper and focused on the later sections, as some details seemed unnecessary. There's a lot of detail, and it's hard to know what's useful, but researchers use the tools they have, even without a guiding theory.

One comment from Slack, Rami, was about double bouquet cells not just aligning receptive fields in layer four but also being present elsewhere. This paper supports that double bouquet cells are found in every layer except L6, and they are present in layers two, three, and five in large quantities. However, another recent paper claimed they only exist in layer three, so the literature is inconsistent. It makes sense to have sets in both lower and upper layers. When papers state that double bouquet cells are only in layer five, does that mean their axons don't reach layer six, or is it just the cell body location? That's a good question. I would be disappointed if they didn't project into layer six. The idea that double bouquet cells might assign phase shifts required for grid cells would be compelling to observe in layer six.

Just as double bouquet cells in layer three or two project to three and four, it's reasonable to expect that, given their axon structure, they might project down to layer six. Someone probably knows, and it's likely documented somewhere.

That's a good hypothesis. That's a prediction we'd like to see. If we didn't see it, I'd have to rethink that theory a bit. From the point of Monty, none of this is terribly important, but it's helpful to be knowledgeable.

In the paper, they talk about late spiking inhibitory cells. I was wondering if we've incorporated any of those in our theories. Does that just mean the initial spike takes a long time? When they do the polarization step, it takes longer for the initial spike. I thought double bouquet cells had that property. Is that not true? They refer to—let me bring it up.

I think it's something called NGC, or neurogliaform cells. They said I didn't talk about those. I think they're in small quantities. I'm not sure these are the right ones. There are these neurogliaform cells, which are tiny cells that don't arborize much. There's very little literature on them. They exist in layers two, three, and some in layer five. I'm not seeing any evidence of them projecting anything. There is so little literature about these neurogliaform cells, and they have such a small spread of activity. I get the impression they're really small and don't extend very far. Maybe they're doing something else, maybe some kind of housekeeping, but I don't know. They didn't talk about them much in the paper. If you want a cell to have an important role in the cortex, it has to form a lot of synapses with other cells and have some sort of presence, like connecting to axon hillocks and so on, as opposed to just being a little cell sitting off to the side. There are lots of other cells in the neocortex, tons of non-neural cells, and some play important roles, but they're not generally involved in information processing.

On double bouquet cells, I had a quick look. The Thompson paper is always useful. I can quickly share, but I just keep hoping she's right, because anytime you Google anything about layer six, this paper always comes up. This is from 1981—just look at the data on that. The sources, but this paper is from 2010. I know, but you decided to get social margin.

Layer four WK cells at least project down to layer six. I think this is what you were talking about: fine unmyelinated axons, which would be potentially very slow. It's also described as slower dendritic inhibition from layer four WK cells to layer six. Maybe I knew that, maybe I didn't. When I looked at this, I remember us talking about it, and I think that's where the earlier description of slow inhibition came from. It can be really slow. The information—how fast can an action potential travel on a thin, unmyelinated axon? Thin makes it slow, and unmyelinated makes it slow.

If it could take a theta cycle—let's say 120 milliseconds—to get from one end to the other, that number exists somewhere. There's a nice study from birds where they looked at conduction delays in local connections.

Conduction delays—this is a long axon. External conduction delays from the peripheral to the CNS. Intercortical axons, unmyelinated. Let's take the normal: it looks like 0.2 millimeters per second. So, per millimeter, per millisecond, how far would that go? Here they do the calculation for you: distribution of axonal path lengths and resulting conduction delays. At the upper extreme, which is rare, it's like 20 milliseconds, but a significant proportion go up to 7 milliseconds. This is to go from where to where?

This is on the scale of maybe half a millimeter. So that's not enough, really.

If I was trying to get a dispersed signal across all phases of the cycle, maybe 8 or 10 hertz—say, a hundred milliseconds—this doesn't fit. I think there's no evidence for that. It's interesting: those axons from the double bouquet cells go up and down, up and down. Maybe they're building a circuit on themselves. I wouldn't rule it out; it's not impossible.

What would happen if you did something like that? You might have some interference pattern. Imagine you have an action potential going down, taking maybe 10 milliseconds, then coming back up again, then going down again. As those signals pass, they might interfere, and the interference pattern could be much longer than the delay.

Where you just have some intermediary neuron, it's like a recurrent circuit that goes back and forth a few times. I'm a cell, a pyramidal cell, and I'm getting multiple synapses from the same double QSO. They get quite a few—there's a number in there—so those synapses could be formed from different branches of the action passing by. When those actual synapses fire, they would be offset, and in some situations, they might align. It's the same kind of oscillatory interference you get with grid cells. The delay might actually result in a much longer delay due to the summation of these different delays. I have to work it out, but I could see that happening. Something has to make it happen, so there must be some mechanism to ensure it.

That's interesting. From our theory's point of view, it's really cool and interesting. From neuroscience, it's pretty cool and interesting, but from a Monty point of view, it's not that important to understand that stuff.

That's a really interesting idea. Thank you. That's a good chart. What paper was that in? It's from this paper by Agar et al., a Neuron paper from 2020. They were doing it for birdsong. They claim that the axonal conduction delay serves an important purpose for spatiotemporal sequences. There's a big question: this is in birds, in a part of their brain that controls the pattern of their birdsong, so clearly time is very important. There could be something similar. Birdsongs aren't that short, so they have to have similar timing requirements that might last 100 milliseconds. If I remember correctly, they also measured conduction delays in rats.

If they're going to explain birdsong, they have to go from something that's only a 10 millisecond delay to songs that are longer than that.

That makes more sense. I was going to say HVC premotor neuron sounds like mammalian stuff, but who knows? Anyway, this is from rat somatosensory cortex.

What's HVC? I don't want HVC.

HVC—maybe that was the bird part. Sorry. I think the somatosensory is the rat. That's right, it's going back to that. They have something there that's less than 0.2.

I would avoid looking at A because that's a logarithmic scale. I'm reading off the logarithmic scale.

The path of the distance—one second. I'm trying to see a chart with the length and the delay, but I have the length and the frequency, and delay and frequency. You have the delay here and the length here. I think the point they're trying to make is that although the distribution of length is different between the species, the delays tend to be the same and tend to be long. I guess they're arguing that's a conserved property or something. That's important. HVC is a part of the bird's brain that's important for producing the songs. Birdsong durations can be long; they're not super short.

So they have to have timing mechanisms that work for playing back sequences like that.

The paper is a combination of measuring these kinds of delays and then putting them in a spiking neural network model, showing that having these delays better explains the sequence produced than without. The birdsong mechanism is highly specific. If I recall, unlike us listening to a melody—we can hear a melody faster or slower and still know it's the same—birds are not like that. If you tweak it even a small amount, they don't recognize it. It's really rigid.

They're probably using different mechanisms than we do. All interesting stuff. One more interesting statistic I found before we go:

When they're applying balanced inhibition, under the section of balancing yin and yang, they talk about how inhibitory synapses are different from excitatory, and the time course of inhibitory synapses is about twofold longer than excitatory currents. They also mention interneurons can discharge two to three times faster than pyramidal neurons. This goes back to the idea of fast spiking that Jeff was talking about—the time course of inhibitory synaptic currents.

If I want the inhibitory neurons to fire very quickly, what does that mean? The time course is longer? It keeps sending neurotransmitters for a longer time. It's not that it happens faster, it just stays active longer. They're trying to balance this with the idea that 16% of all synapses on pyramidal neurons are inhibitory. If there are only 16%, how can we balance it with inhibitory synapses? That's a crazy idea, because it ignores the idea that dendrites are active processing elements. If you think about a dendritic tree as just summing the inputs from all these synapses, you could say there are a lot of excitatory synapses and not as many inhibitory, so how can that be? But that's based on a poor understanding of how dendrites work. If you think about dendrites as active integration zones and the threshold of local dendritic spikes, then this concern goes away completely. This paper was written in 2004, so that's 20 years ago. Maybe we can forgive them. I don't remember when people really started understanding dendritic spikes—maybe it was around that time—but nowadays you would never write that, because we know they're not just summation. That makes sense.
