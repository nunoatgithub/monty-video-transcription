Jeff Hawkins: gonna talk about two things. I'm just gonna talk about our mission again. I know Vivian talked about this a bit. I'm gonna give you my take on that. And then I want to give you a really high-level picture of the goals. You've heard a lot of details in these presentations, a lot of amazing work that's been going on to the system, but sometimes it's really helpful just to bop up again, take a look at the top picture. So let's just start with the Thousand Brains Project's mission. It all starts here. Vivian mentioned this, it can be summed up in this one sentence. We're creating machine intelligence technology based on neocortical principles. There's a lot in this sentence, I want to unpack it. First of all, I prefer the word machine intelligence over artificial intelligence. to me, today's AI is not really intelligent. It doesn't mean it's not useful, it doesn't mean it's not great, it's just not the real thing. And we're trying to create the real thing here, the things that we all can agree to. Since we're building machines that work the same way that biological intelligence works. We're really focused on building a technology. We're not focused on applications, we're not trying to build on business. It reminds me, I don't want to get too heady here, but I really do think what we're doing is sorta what happened in the 1940s when the pioneers of computing set down the technology framework for computing, which lasted for many decades and still today. And I think that's what we're doing, something similar here, we're building the fundamental technology and the theory behind what intelligent systems are like. And of course we're using neocortical principles to do this and we're only able to do that because we've spent so many decades working on this and made amazing progress in understanding how the brain works. So that's our goal, that's our mission. I thought I'd mention just again remind you of the top principles involved here. The top principles, my top three, we can disagree about these. My top three principles is that these systems are sensorimotor. They have sensors which sense the world. We're not feeding some abstract data into them. The sensors that sense the world, they're moved through the world, so there's motion involved. Sensorimotor integration is used for learning, for inference, and for solving problems. So it's not an add-on piece, you add a motor to it, every learning module has a motor output. The whole system is a sensorimotor. One of the things that people just, I don't think appreciate enough that when you learn this way, you have these structured models. You heard about reference frames. Everything that's ever processed in the brain and in Monty is not only what it is but where it is. Where being the pose, location, and orientation. That's how knowledge is structured in your brain, that's how knowledge is structured in Monty. This provides all these amazing abilities to manipulate knowledge, to rotate at things, to navigate through a reference frame or through a structured space to solve problems. This is really the key to the strength of the system. And of course it's a highly distributed architecture and the learning module is a very powerful thing. But really the systems become powerful because the same learning modules can be applied to different type of modalities, different parts of hierarchy, allows us to build systems of different sensory modalities, different embodiments, different levels of capabilities. It's an incredibly modular system that nature has discovered and we're trying to replicate. You've heard about some of these attributes that's come along with this. Continuous learning, can't overemphasize how important that is. To make a system that actually solves real-world problems, it has to, moment to moment, learn what the current reality is. Where did I leave this thing? Where's my tools? What's happening? Who's there? What things have just changed in the last minute? And the system has to be able to do those things and of course along comes with that is a super low power and minimal training. Our goals for 2026 We basically we have 3 broad goals, and you've heard about all of them today. And this is our goals for 2025, these are our goals for 2026. This is a system. First, we have to expand our community. We're 8 people full-time, which is very small. What we're building is going to be much, much larger than any one company or organization can manage. We need to get more people involved and excited. Will gave you a good introduction of how you can get involved. If nothing else, tell people about the Thousand Brains Project. We think this is really important. Then you heard from Tristan about how we have to build a platform, that's really essential too. I spend most of my time, and some of the research people do, about adding capabilities. I used to say research but I changed it today to say add capabilities because actually, it turns out the number of things we have to do research on is decreasing. There aren't too many big things left to figure out. And we're moving more into a sort of an implementation mode on these things. As you've heard throughout this we did do a lot of work on compositional models. How the world of objects are structured of other objects. We understand that. We're implementing that. That should be integrated completely into Monty this year. We learned last year how the same learning modules can learn the behavioral dynamics of the world, how things in the world change. And of course the world isn't static. But fortunately, we didn't have to come up with new algorithms for that. It was an amazingly simple switch from what the inputs to the learning modules are. Now we have models of behaviors. How things are expected to behave over time. And once you have those two things, once you understand the structure, the static structure of the world, and then the dynamic structure of the world, we are able to now start approaching goal-oriented behaviors. Like, how do we use behaviors to manipulate the world to reach various states? This is all coming together. I don't expect that we'll have all this implemented this year. I know we won't almost certainly. But I think by the end of this year our goal would be to have a very solid theory of goal-oriented behaviors and understand causality. So that perhaps in 2027, we'll fill out the whole thing. I want to emphasize again, how that there's really not a lot of major things left to done. The beginning of this project moved very slowly. For years and years, it was difficult to make progress. But now things are moving quickly because we have all these pieces in place. And it's now just rejiggering the components and adding some new things to it. So it's getting to be a very exciting time for this whole endeavor. And with that I want to thank for those who are listening today live, those of you who are listening online later, those who have contributed to the project so far, we talk about you all the time, we really appreciate the effort you do. And I think now I'm going to leave it, and we're going to now talk do some QA. I think Will's going to moderate that if I remember correctly.
