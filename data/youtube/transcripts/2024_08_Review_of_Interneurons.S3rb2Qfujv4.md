All right. We're bringing this paper, interneurons and neocortical inhibitory system. I thought I would, start with a little background material here, switch to my, PowerPoint here. So, there was a time in the past when I started studying neuroscience, there was two classifications of neurons. There were excitatory neurons and inhibitory neurons. And, in the excitatory neurons, it was very clear what the two, there were two types. There are pyramidal cells and spiny stellate cells, and there's no question about these cells. Everyone agrees they're there, they're very consistent. And then the inhibitory neurons are kind of a mixed bag. what, what, the reason the two pyramidal cells and spiny stellate cells were in the same category is they both had an excitatory effect on their postsynaptic cells. So if they would form a synapse on another cell, that would excite the other cell. Those synapses are all spiny, meaning they have the spines. they would only form these synapses on the dendrites. That's the only place they would form synapses. And it's generally assumed that this is where learning occurs on these spiny synapses. So whether they're changing their effect, their effectiveness or they're growing new ones. That's where learning occurred. the inhibitory neurons. Can you clarify, sorry, just real quick, what the spiny refers to again? It's, it's that spine, Because there's like the bouton in a synapse. Well, well, bouton is a fancy word for spine. Okay.

so this is a little character drawing here, but you know, Yeah. Those are the spine so that the excitatory synapses. Are almost all on spines, meaning they don't, they don't, the axon and the dendrite don't actually connect to each other. There's a little spine that goes between them that grows out of the dendrite. So, so when, when original people like Kaha would look at these images, they'd see these spines. They see these little bumps all over the dendrites and they call those, you know, those are spiny, neurons or spiny, synapses. Is that clear? Yeah, yeah, thanks. Yeah, whoops. I'm gonna go back here. So, this is contrast to the inhibitory neurons when they form this, there's different types. There's, there's lots of different types, large basket cells, small basket cells, chandelier cells, double bouquet cells, martinati cells, almost all these descriptions come back from the time when people just looking at images and they're trying to describe what the cells look like. This is back 18, you know, 1900. They had no idea what any of this stuff was doing, but they would just say, hey, this is what it looks like. A pyramidal cell, they call the pyramidal because the cell body is like a triangle. It looks like a little pyramid. And the spiny stellate cells, like a little star, and they wanted to distinguish from other stellate looking cells, so they said this is the one that forms, has spiny synapses. anyway, so there's all these different, and these other cells, these large baskets, these inhibitory neurons, they all have an inhibitory effect, they, they make the, the, they form a synapse, which makes the recipient cell less likely to fire. but there are inconsistent classifications and inconsistent nomenclature. So various researchers have used different words for the same cells, it's kind of a mess. those synapses are inhibitory and they're called aspiny. If you actually looked under my electron microscope, you would not see a spine, you'd see the, the, there'd just be a sort of a slight little, picker spot on the, on the dendrite where the axon and the dendrite connect. The, the inhibitory synapses. They can form on the soma, the cell body. They can form on the axon hillock, which is the beginning of the axon, or they can form in the dendrites. So, unlike the excitatory neurons, which only form, excitatory synapses are only formed on the dendrites. These inhibitory ones can be anywhere on the cell, but these three basic areas, and it's generally assumed that they're involved in regulation, not memory. So the, the, they would enforce sparsity or synchronization or rhythms or some sort of operational states of the, of the system. that's the general view that people had and still have mostly.

Let's talk about the pyramidal neurons and only pyramidal neurons have apical dendrites. These are the big dendrites that go up towards the, towards the top of the layer of the cortex. And a pyramidal cells and only pyramidal cells and all of them send a branch of their axon. outside of the column. So all cells form lots of synapses locally within their column, but the pyramidal neurons always, there's no exceptions to this I'm aware of, will send an axon that leaves the cortex and goes someplace else. stellate cells, the spinae stellate cells look just like the pyramidal cells, but they don't have the apical dendrite and they don't have the long range axon. So they form similar kind of local connections. and so there was some papers published, or at least one paper published that we read that was basically arguing that stellate cells are really just perimetal cells that don't have an apical dendrite. But, you know, otherwise they operate the same. anyway, somewhere along the way, it was found out that some of the inhibitory neurons are not always inhibitory, and they can act in an excitatory fashion under some conditions, so they changed the nomenclature. The new nomenclature is we have pyramidal neurons and interneurons. Interneurons are defined as neurons that don't send their axon outside of the local, column. So they've moved the spinate stellate cell. Down into the interneuron category, which is very confusing because they're really not like these other neurons. They're really more like the pyramidal neurons, but this is the nomenclature that they've settled on, which could be confusing, perhaps if maybe not. Maybe it is, but it shouldn't bother me. I start because you can even see it in the paper. We're about to, about the review here. I just wanted to show you this picture just to make sure we're all on the same level when I'm talking about various things here. So this is a, this is not a, this is a pyramidal neuron. This picture looks like it's a bit of complex. Part of it looks like it was actually a photomicrograph, and part of it looks like it was hand drawn. I don't know. But here's a pyramidal cell, and it has this triangular cell body, which is why it's called pyramidal. These are the basal dendrites here and here. There's lots of synapses on them. This is the apical dendrite here, and these are, this is called the tuft. It's the upper part. most primal neurons don't have these little offshoots coming off, which are called Schaefer collaterals. Only some don't, but most don't. this is the axon hillock here. You can see my pointer, I hope, right? You can see my pointer. Is that right? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So this is the axon, which also branches and profusely connects to other cells nearby. They're not showing that at all. But when we talk about the axon hillock, it's this very initial segment of, of the axon. So when a cell spikes, the body gets depolarized. The soma gets depolarized. And, meaning it's normally at a resting potential of, let's say, minus 70 millivolts. It's polarized. To be depolarized, the voltage goes up a bit, and if it gets above a certain threshold, then the cell spikes. But what actually happens is the depolarization occurs here, but the action potential starts right here at the axon hillock. So there are, there's these chandelier cells, which forms synapses right on this axon hillock, which will have a very big effect on whether this cell, you know, actually sends a spike down its axon. Notice that, this is not mentioned in the paper we're going to do here, but I've always wondered why would it do this, and we have some new data about it. But one thing, it probably wouldn't prevent the cell from sending a back action potential up its, up its, down its dendrites because it's really just stopping the beginning of this action potential going down here. So along, there are, there are synapses on the cell body. You can see some of the little bumps here, but those are all inhibitory synapses. You never find excitatory synapses on the cell body. you only find the excitatory synapses along the dendrites out here. So there's inhibitory synapses on the axon hillock, on the cell body, and there's also inhibitory synapses, some spread out along here on these dendrites. it's, it's a small percentage of the synapses, but there are, there are definitely synapses along here, and so inhibitory synapses, so you, you'd imagine what's going on here is that these different types of inhibition have different effects. the ones I've always imagined, the ones that are along the dendrites would probably just change the threshold for generating a dendritic spike. So they would make, if the cell, if not enough cells were active, you might, if you, if you, if you inhibit, if you change the inhibition out here, you could get these cells to generate more NMDA spikes or more, where the, where the, the, inhibition on the cell would effectively shut down all activity of the cell. And so we would imagine that would be good for creating sparsity and, and the, the inhibitory synapses could do various things. One is that I just read, I didn't realize before, was that, on the axon hill, these synapses might be involved in getting cells to be synchronized, which is interesting. Okay, so there's this, and so they show here. my, my cursor keeps disappearing. This is a chandelier cell, which is forms these little, this little row of synapses here on lots of other act, parameter cells. It's called the chandelier cells because these, when they stained it, it looked, these look like little candles on a chandelier, and then they show here a double bouquet cell, which we've been talking about. Which has this very narrow axon, this is the axon here, believe it or not, and it's this huge bushy string of axon, axon that it seems to be associated with many columns, and then here's a picture of a large basket cell, which just inhibits a lot of other cells, primarily by inhibiting the somas. So this gives you a sense of the kind of things we're talking about. Stop me if you want me to. Let's talk about something. Let's talk about something. All right, so here's the paper, that Romney found, and I read earlier, and then I agreed to a review. The title itself is interesting, because it says, Interneurons of the Neocortical Inhibitory System. So already, they're making a distinction. They're going to, they're going to leave out spiny stellate cells, because they're only going to talk about inhibitory cells. So they already have this, this. Already, they're dealing with the fact that interneurons, is not a good term for inhibitory cells anymore, so. And then, this, this highlighted line at the end of the abstract says, This review focused on organizing principles that govern the diversity of inhibitory interneurons and their circuits. Again, they'll be mostly leaving out the spiny stellate cells, even though those are interneurons, because they're not inhibitory. It's essentially now when most people have absolutely no idea of what the circuits in the cortex are doing. We have lots of ideas on that, but most people don't. And, and so what a lot of these scientists will do is just try to come up with ways of characterizing cells. And this paper goes to a lot of different ways you can look at these, these inhibitory interneurons. And classify them in various different ways. It's quite, it's quite complex and none of it, most of it's, a lot of it's not very useful, at least I don't find it useful. But that's what this paper is doing. It says, okay, we're going to talk about all these, these inhibitory antineurons and all the different ways that we can organize them and classify them and say what they do and don't do.

this line here, this, this gets a standard statement you'll see. Everywhere that in the neocortex, 70 to 80 of the cells are exci, excitatory, parametal neurons, also spinella cells, which are smaller in number. and they have relatively stereotyped anatomical physiological and molecular properties. As I said earlier, they're parametal cells are very, very similar. the remaining 23rd percent of neocortical neurons are inter neurons, mostly inhibitory, which have diverse morphological, physiological, molecular, and synaptic characteristics. So they're really different all over the map. And that's what they're going to try to talk about here.

This, this little highlighted text here says interneurons can also be excitatory. This spondylostelic cell is an important type.

you know, so they're saying yes, this is another interneuron. but for the most part they don't really talk about it in the rest of the paper because it's not inhibitory. here they say these cells are found only in layer four. I'm surprised in primary centripetors. I, I know that was the way they originally thought of it, but I think they're found elsewhere now, so. I don't know if that's still true anymore. and they also say, this is something I never saw before, they say the spiny stellate cells have a partial apical like dendrite that can reach layer three. I've never heard of that. I know they have their, their, their dendrites go spread around, but I've never heard they have a partial apical like dendrite. And I, I didn't, I didn't see a reference for that. So I don't know why they said that. All right, here's the first figure. This figure is a very cartoonish drawing of the different types of cells. And it's talking about the, you know, the anatomical diversity. So the cells actually don't look like this at all, of course. they threw up here the spinae stellate cell. That's an excitatory cell. Then they said there's some cells that, that target the soma and the proximal dendrites. So these are formed, these will form inhibitory synapses on the cell body and the proximal dendrites. And in this category are mostly basket cells. I've often heard of large basket cells and small basket cells. I've never heard of nest basket cells, and they introduced that one here, so I don't know when that appeared. it clearly, other scientists probably won't include the nest basket cell. Maybe they'll say it's a large or a small. So, you know, how they classify these things is kind of a, it's somewhat arbitrary. not completely. Then they say these are cells that just target the dendrites. And then this category is the double bouquet cell, bipolar cells, which are also, double bouquet cells are also bipolar cells, or at least some people say they are. and then these, there's a special here, this Martin 80 cell, which is interesting because it seems to target primarily the layer one, apical dendrites, and it spreads very wide in, in layer one. So we know that there's a lot of spread of activity in layer one as part of the paper we're writing. This is an inhibitory cell that seems to inhibit. The, the, the, the, the dendrites in layer one. And then there's the chandelier cell we were just talking about, which forms these, little cassettes of multiple synapses on the axon hillock and, and, on, on, on, on terminal cells. So they're just giving you sort of the lay of the land here before they go into details. Any questions on that? So, we expect the soma targeting cells to be, to have a higher inhibitory effect than the other dendrite targeting cells. well, it has a different effect. One would, if you inhibit, if you inhibit the soma, you're basically trying, you're preventing the cell from firing at all, right? If I, if I, if I have an, inhibitory synapse on a dendrite, I'm going to reduce the chance That it generates a, dendritic spike, which is part of our theory is, but the dendritic spikes are like a prediction. It doesn't prevent the cell from firing at all. It just says, I'm going to make it harder or easier, for the dendrite to generate a dendritic spike. one, you know, I've always imagined like, you know, there's a, there's a threshold on dendrites. And like, if you have like 15 to 20 synapses active in a very small area, we've written about this, 40 microns or so, it'll generate, and they become active at the same time, it'll generate a dendritic spike. Well, I just imagine, I don't have any evidence of this, but imagine if I have It's dispersed along that dendrite. I have some inhibitory synapses that are either more or less active. I can change the threshold from being 15 to 20 to maybe 20 to 25 or maybe 10 to 15. The one, one thing you could do is if you have too many cells that are becoming active, this could be, or let's say, let's say there was, there was not enough predictive activity. You could, you could change the threshold and now. You loosen things up. I used to always imagine like if I say, Oh, look at a cloud, you see the dog in the cloud. Well, there really isn't a dog in that cloud. And normally you wouldn't see a dog, but you do something in your brain. Also, you say, Oh, yeah, I see there's a dog, you know, because it's like a dog. I always imagine what was going on there was that you're changing the thresholds on the dendrites. So you didn't have enough real evidence for a dog, but if you just lower the threshold a bit, it's okay. Maybe there's a dog like that. I'm not going to go through most of this paper, because it's really, yeah. The question I just had was, maybe you were going to get to this, but when we talk about double bouquet cells, I feel like we often, at least computationally, kind of talk about them as excitatory neurons, or at least that's how I pictured it. In terms of like defining the receptive field, but is, is it something about like a inhibition of inhibition or something like, how do they, right, right. I've generally kind of learned to ignore those ideas because when you might find, I didn't, I didn't check this, you know, the, the double bouquet cells may, a couple of things may be happening. They may have a background firing rate, which then is reduced. And so they're, they're, they're at some constant threshold of inhibition, then you reduce the inhibition, or there could be a, a, a double inhibition, going on. Like, do these, do these guys also innervate, you know, that. You'd like to chandelier cells. Right, right, right, right. It's complicated. It's very difficult to. I found it difficult to track this down and, these kinds of things. And so I, I used to worry about that a lot, Niels, and I just stopped worrying about it because it seems like, Yeah, no, no, that makes sense. Thanks. Yeah. Is the data there, do we really know the background firing rates of double bouquet cells and what's it, when the animals attending versus not attending? And it's like, Oh my God, you know, there's so many variables here that change in real life scenarios that. It's just hard to get the data you would like to have for some of these things. this is a, this is another picture. They're, they're just showing the different, the the propensity of the different cells in different layers. You know, you could try to make something of this, but you know, there's so much data here. You just can't look at this and go, Oh, actually, what's going on? It's just data. and once you have a theory. You can sometimes go and look at data like this. Oh, maybe the support doesn't support the theory. but up front, it just says, okay, in layer six, this is how many of these cells you have. It might be interesting. Okay, they got more small basket cells than any other layer. Okay, well, the general idea, I think, for a small basket cells, it's this basket cells. I believe and other people suggested or just generally there to create in a sparsity to make sure not too many cells is firing and the small ones are more limited in areas that might be within a column and a large ones seem to extend beyond the comp so that would be like column to column inhibition as well. So, anyway, the small basket cells thing, maybe you have, maybe you have higher sparsity down here. I don't know.

I'm not going to go through each cell to you. I just this is the one here on the double bouquet cell since we've been talking about them a lot.

and, these words all describe what we've been talking about. have a bitufted, meaning it goes in both directions, up and down, morphology for the dendrites, not the axons. We're talking about the dendritic morphology. their special feature is a tight axonal cylinder. So, the thing that's really tight and that's narrow is the axonal, the axon. And I don't even know what fasciscular means. I think it means, I don't know, highly branching or something like that. And it resembles a horsetail. Sometimes they actually call these horsetail cells. So you might see that in early literature.

they talk about some of the details of it.

and it says they're interleaved with pyramidal cells, inhibit their basal dendrites.

see here, anyway, that it's just, this is just language to describe what the cells look like. Then we get into things like this. there's a whole bunch of, there's like, there's neuropeptides and there's proteins. That, that they can use to categorize these cells. I'm not even sure exactly how they categorize them, but then you can, and then, and so that they're listing some three, these calcium binding proteins here, and then these four of these neuropeptides that are associated with different cell types. And then on the right is different types of, firing patterns. They can, they can characterize what the spike patterns look like. so, adapting with a here, non adapting here, stuttering, and so on. I forget what IS stands for, irregular spiking. So they make up names for these different patterns they see. And so I'm going to call that, and then you can associate the cell with the neuropeptide, with the different patterns in which they spike, and Okay. Yeah, I have no idea what to do with that. You know, it's like it's there, but it's like, what to do with it?

this is an interesting one up here, this little highlighted text. So we're talking about electrical properties of neurons. Originally, all inhibitory neurons were described as fast spiking. So what that means is, it'd be two things. One is, How quickly they generate the first spike, but also then, how fast the spikes occur, but I think the more important one is how quickly generate the first spike. And so our, our theory of the, the temporal memory theory requires that when a pyramidal cell becomes active, it, it then inhibits all of its neighbors. And so if the pyramidal cell activates an inhibitory then has to activate all the other cells before they can spike, spike. And this system has to work really fast. And, and someone did the, did the, the simulation of this on our behalf. And they said, yeah, it could work. that's an important part of our theory that, that happened. Now they talk about here in the paper, they talk about the different response properties of these cells. Unfortunately, these response properties are almost always detected. In some sort of slice preparation. So they've taken the brain out of the animal. They sliced it up. They put in some liquid to keep it sort of live. And then there's two ways they do it. There's a steady state response types. meaning, they, they, they inject current into the soma, into the cell body. So they just, a little electrical probe, and they, they just inject current continuously, sustained current. And so the cell doesn't get to relax. And so then they say, oh, well, what kind of spikes does it generate? And then the other one is they can do a, a step depolarization, like what happens on the very initial pulse of current, the onset response types. And so they can classify those.

Before I go on, this is another figure they've thrown in here, which is showing the number of synapses that individuals interneurons make on the pyramidal cells. So, you know, this value number is, again, very hard to interpret in any meaningful way.

then, then they, they say, you know, okay, we're looking at these response types, you know, like a pulse. Well, how's it respond to a pulse and how's it respond to current injection, current, current injection. And then they say, well, you know, it's a useful means, but maybe they're not really real. So they're saying, they say extrapolating these, here I said, what I say here, slice preparation, maybe it's leading, that's my summary of this. Extrapolating these types of in vivo simulation, meaning, through the in vivo, like, what would actually happen in a live animal, is, is really, it's hard to say because the brain is sliced, perfused with artificial fluid. And, you know, we see his greater synaptic environment and are subject to neuromodulator control, which is, you know, which could profoundly change his discharge property. So basically you're saying, yeah, these things, the way we characterize these cells may not be accurate at all, in a live animal. So, you know, it's not that it's not useful, but you have to just You know, remember that these things aren't like set in stone. then they talked about ion channel composition. So ion channels, these are the, these are the channels, these along the cell membrane of a cell and they can, they can parse these interneurons by different types of ion channels. again, not, not really easy to interpret, in any, in any revealing way. And then they can look at genetic expressions, and they can go all kinds of crazy stuff, you know, gene clusters, it's not, it's not really worth going into all this. these are like, these are some of the different, these are different cell response properties, and this, this is based on, you can see down my highlight here, based on steady state response to sustained current injection in the soma. Again, they have a cell in slice, they inject current into the cell, and some cells will, they'll behave different ways. And they'll have like a, you know, a series of spikes or non series of spikes or a little burst in between and, and they characterize, they put names on these things, trying to sort these into classifications, which are not, unreasonable, but again, very, very difficult to interpret. Say, well, what's the point of this? I think one thing we've learned, and that this is something that Sherman and go have really proposed a lot is, is that most parmal neurons in and, most cell cells, they generally have a sort of, they don't really burst very often. they, they have a steady state spiking. And when you have, when you have a little burst, like these things here are bursts. So these things here, a burst, or even at the beginning of this one, here's a little burst of a bunch of spikes right in a row really quickly. When this reaches the destination neuron, it can, those bursts can cause metabolic changes, meaning they can cause the receiving cell to actually grow something or change something physically, you know, it can express genes and, and make things happen that are not just like, not just like voltage depolarization. so, you know, so these bursts really do matter, but it's very complex. It's hard to say exactly.

I'm not going to go through most of this stuff here. Here's another another take of the same things, different cell types, different types of, spiking patterns. I'm not. I'm not actually sure.

oh, this is according to discharge responses at steady state and onset phase. So this is like the I think I think this is like the pulse version of the one I showed earlier. Again, you look at this and go, what am I gonna do with this information? I didn't know what to do.

So here is, they talk about, you know, the interneurons themselves, even though they're mostly inhibitory, they get excitatory synapses. So they talk a little about that.

I'm like, oh, there's some interesting clues here. Like, They're talking about some sort of delays and stuff, and they said, which might cause targeted inhibitory cells deep in corticolitis joints before those in supergranular layers. So this is the kind of thing I would pick up and say, oh, that's interesting. They're, they're basically saying that there, there's some, there's some properties here which might make the upper layers go first and the lower layers go second, or the opposite way. The lower layers go first, the upper layers go second. So I just highlight things that catch my attention like that. This is another, lovely but really not very useful chart. It shows the, let's see, correlation map between the different ion channel genes with specific electrical parameters. So I guess if you were like Studying some disease and there was some disease related with various ion channels, and you wanna know the genes that are expressing to make those ion channels, this might be useful. but from my point of view, if I understand how the brain works, this is not very useful at all. nothing bad about it, it's just can't really do anything with it. This is, This is interesting here. So there's this new idea, which I'd read once, but I just, I just got more introduced to it very recently, is, is that that these inhibitory cells aren't always inhibitory, they, the same synapses can be inhibitory or excitatory under different conditions.

so it says here, a single neocortical neuron can receive both depressing and facilitated GABA and synapses. GABA is the, is the inhibitory neurotransmitter.

if an interneuron has a delayed onset response, synapses tend to be depressing. If the onset response is classic or bursting, synapses tend to be facilitating. So they're saying, okay, we now are saying some of these, some of these synapses can be, can be inhibitory, some can be excitatory.

look at this orange one here.

I said neurons that preferentially target an axon initial segments. Those are the chandelier cells. And I'm going to skip the rest of the important part of the sentences are involved in phasing and synchronization, synchronizing neural activity. So, this is really interesting. I used to think that, you know, like all these inhibitory synapses would just prevent a cell from firing. But that may be true, but misleading, because it really may be just saying, don't fire right this second. I want you to wait a little bit or fire a little bit earlier. And it's, it might be just saying, I want you to change the timing of your spike as opposed to spike or non spike. Let me just jump to another paper here, which I have. This is a paper about chandelier cells. These are the ones that form the synapses on the axon Hilic, and I read this paper, here, here's like a diagram. Here's the, the red is their axons. These are little, these little things on each peral cells ax. And then here, here, okay, so this, this sentence here says, activation of the chand cells. Shortly before the expected parametal neuron spike evoked reliable inhibition. On the other hand, activation of the chandelier cell at earlier points in time evoked hyperpolarization and depolarizing effects. They're saying if the chandelier cell fires right before the pyramidal cell is about to fire, it will inhibit the pyramidal cell. But other times it might, might, excite or, or make the cell more likely to fire. And so the idea here is it's similar to like, timing dependent plasticity. This seems to be like a timing dependent spike formation. And it suggests that the chandelier cells may be actually just They, they may be not just, they may be just changing when the, when the parameter cell actually generates a spike, and it would be a way for getting parameter cells to all spike at the same time. This has always been a, an odd thing in neuroscience because for, for like dendritic spikes to occur, these, these action potentials have to arrive at pretty much the same time within a millisecond or a few milliseconds. And so this is a really interesting idea that these shandler cells may be really changing the spike timing exactly, of when spikes, come out of the primal cell, and it may be a synchronization method, and I've seen some other references to that as well. So that's pretty cool.

so, that's what they're referring to here. Neurons that preferentially target initial segments, which would be the chandelier cells, are involved in phasing and synchronization, synchronizing neural activity, and there's some references there which I didn't read, so that would be, if I wanted to follow that idea, if you look at those, Those three references.

Here's another, here's another chart. That's mind, mind numbing.

mapping glutamate synapses from neocortical pyramidal neurons onto interneuron. So these are like, here's a pyramidal cell and just saying, okay, the pyramidal cell is going to form excitatory synapses on these different, these different types of inhibitory cells and what kind of synaptic responses you get on those inhibitory cells. And, so yeah, that's what, that's what it's about. Again, I don't know what to do with that. let's keep going down here. This is interesting here. They say, why balance yin with yang, with their, yang with yin? What they're talking about here is, the neurons want to be excited, but then you have this inhibition. They're basically saying, why do you have excitatory and inhibitory things going on at the same time? And there's no mention in this paper at all about sparsity and advantages of sparsity or why you'd want to inhibit neurons. you know, I don't, I don't recall them ever saying anywhere in this paper why you'd want to inhibit neurons. But, I thought that's pretty funny that they don't really. They don't go there.

again, they talk about, you know, there's different ways of classifying the things. Maybe we're not getting it right at all.

I thought this, I just highlighted this section because a lot of good statistics, not that we need to go through them, but it had a lot of numbers. You know, about 60 of the syns on AAL neuron in layers two, three are inhibitory. And these come from about 70 inch neurons, half being basket cells, roughly 50 of these are neurons from the same layer, blah, blah, blah. You know, so this the kind of thing I could say. Well, someday if I ever really needed to get some details on this, this, there was a nice paragraph on that. And then they conclude, and they basically, the conclusion is just a summary of the, there's a common cortical circuit, a template neocortical micro circuit seems to have been duplicated repeatedly to construct a neocortex. In terms of its general architecture, this template is highly stereotypical, quote, a generic microcircuit with subtle specializations that presumably optimize processing in different brain regions.

in terms of its functions near microcircuit, at any one location seems to support simultaneous processing of multiple features. I don't know what they meant by that. anyway, basically they're saying it's a common microcircuit here. Alright, so that's my read on this paper. It hasn't been much discussion, but I don't know if you have any thoughts or questions about it.

I have maybe one question. somewhere in the paper they talk about something called, differential synaptic transmission. What was the word? I didn't hear the word. Differential synaptic. Let me maybe share my screen.

That's your own notes. Your notes are probably better than my notes.

Yeah, they talk about something called differential synaptic transmission. And, can you see my screen? Yeah, yeah. And the pointer. and, yeah, they refer to it as, some sort of short term synaptic plasticity where the way I interpreted it is from excitatory, cells that, they can basically, these excitatory cells can kind of like route, their, neurotransmitters or they can, they can cause some dendrites to be more depressed or facilitated, in a short term that, that usually lasts less than a second. when I looked up that synaptic prolasticity, thing. And, the way I interpret it is that these excitatory can actually, cause different dendrites to have, different effects on the postsynaptic neuron. And I, I really didn't, know that before. I, I don't know if this is true or not. I was just checking my Well, I'm, I'm, I'm still not sure what it means. Can you, scroll down so I can see the sentence before this? What are we, what part of it, what are we looking at in the paper here? so, we're in the category of interneurons. Is that where we are? Yeah. Okay. And then, all right. They're saying that these, these synapses typically forming clusters, a small fraction of the dendrites.

okay, so these are, these are, these are excitatory synapses on inhibitory cells, I think, right? And, and instead of being spread out like we require on perimetral cells because we're trying to recognize sparse patterns here, they're just grouped together, meaning like this, this excitatory cell is just going to activate this inhibitory cell. Okay, so that's where we are. Keep, I can't, I'm trying to work my way up to where you had that, that sentence, which I didn't understand. Physiological properties, okay, so, Unlike, glutamergic synapses on excitatory cells, glutamergic synapses on inhibitory cells are different. Okay, can you go back to the top of the page now?

Okay. and often have frequency dependent, frequency dependent facilitation. These features are often found in some interneurons, in some of the different types of therapeutic behavior. Glutamergic system may have a functional dichotomy of different modes for recruiting parietal neurons and interneurons.

Yeah, I feel like it's actually clearer if you if you scroll down the paragraph under. Yeah, I feel like that kind of it's a weird ordering, but I feel like this kind of explained it. It's basically like in hip synapses from accessory cells on inhibitory neurons. That actually has an inhibitory effect, is my understanding. The static, dynamic depression infiltration across layers, which might cause target inhibitory cells in the, But they're basically depressing synapses, even though they're coming from excitatory cells, which is why I guess they're called differential, because it's like, different from normally what glutamate does. Right, right. First I'm thinking like, differential like there's some difference in time, but they're basically just saying, hey, the same The same cell can have different effects, right? Different effects on different membranes. So, okay, so let's figure that out. that goes back to, I guess, the earlier comment I made earlier where they used to think these things were just pure inhibitory. You know, everyone assumed that, you know, the same kind of synapses result in the same kind of things, but it's not always the case. So what was it now? Are you confused by this? No, it, it just, the way I interpreted is that the same excitatory cell when it, when it releases an, when it spikes or makes an action potential, it doesn't have the same effect on, all of the synapses. It can actually, either facilitate or depress some of those synapses, but this, but those are just synapses on, on inhibitory neurons, right? Yeah. Yeah. I I don't think that's true on when a parameter cell connects to a perial cell that I don't think that's true. Yeah, that was part of what I was, yeah, so so then I would then I would put this into, you know, I made this bucket early on. Like, is this where learning occurs or is this some sort of regulatory function? Right? And this to me, when, as soon as you're psychomorphic synapses on these inhibitory cells or the interneurons, you're into some sort of regulatory function. and once you're into the regulatory function, it's a, it's a wild zoo of unknown possibilities, right? Anything can happen, and it almost seems like anything does happen, right? It's, it's a really different story. So. I guess that kind of stuff that Rami, that is like one of 20 things in this paper that are like, huh? Oh, that's interesting. Huh? Okay. What am I supposed to make of that? so again, my, my take on this kind of stuff is, you know, we started off by just totally ignoring inhibitory cells. in our theories, other than we said we have to have sparsity and because there's just too much unknown, there's too many weird stuff and it doesn't seem to be where learning is occurring. So, so then we just focus on how could learning occur within excitatory cells, pyramidal cells. you know, and then and then when we need a regulatory function, you know, we can go look into the bag of, you know, mixed mass stuff like in this paper and try to find it. Like, you know, what? What? How do grid cells work? Well, that requires all kinds of weird stuff. And some of it appears to require sort of shifting, you know, phases of certain cells and, you know, that's probably going to be happening using interneurons with some sort of, I don't know, who the hell knows how that happens. No one knows. So, it's kind of like, okay, well, if we need something, we need a system to do something, it's probably going to be done by the interneurons and maybe we can tease out how they do it. The example I gave earlier where the basket cell had to be the, the, the, had to support this idea that we have, you know, a burst of cells and a quickly winning cell in the temporal memory algorithm. Well, that was the first time we could say, okay, we need, we need an inhibitory cell to do something specific. And the basket cells, we're pretty sure that's them, and they're pretty well characterized. And so now we had a reason to go look at basket cells and see, could they do what we, we think they need to do? And that was a positive experience. Whereas most of these cells, we don't have anything like that at all. Do we think, do we, have we considered that, perhaps maybe the double bouquet cells are doing the inhibition across the column? Like for lateral inhibition in one column? A lateral inhibition in a column? Yeah, like, if one of the, if one of the cells in the mini column excites that, that and hit the double bouquet cell. Well, it could be.

oh, no, I don't think so, actually. I think the double bouquet cells are slow, if I recall. They're not very fast cells. and they wouldn't sit that purpose, and they, they would, you know, what, what the, the, the, I don't think so. I, I, I think that's the main reason it was kind of slow. you know, there was an interesting question I had early on, which is like, well, you know, the classic Hubel and Wiesel experiments, they show all these cells in a minicom have the same basic response properties. And I always ask myself, well, how did, how did that happen? You know, what makes these cells have the same response properties? And most neuroscientists just assumed it was genetic. And I always felt like, no, that can't be true because, and they would, and they would argue that, look, when an animal is born, it already has those response properties, but then there's these waves that go across the retina. It's complicated. But I said throughout the cortex, you know, it's almost impossible that all those mini columns have the response properties are genetically determined. So what forces these cells to have the same response properties. So I actually, before I knew a lot about double bouquet cells, I said, there has to be some sort of interneuron that is enforcing that. It just has to, there has to be some mechanism that forces these things and forces them to all have the same response property. And on top of that, that cell, and so then I looked at double bouquet cells to sort of fit the bill. They're just, you know, perfectly aligned with these minicoms. At least they have the ability to control all the cells in the minicom in some way. And then we also said, well, then those double bouquet cells probably also have to have the same response property as the cells in the minicom. And sure enough, they do. So that was another prediction. That said, they should respond, and they do, they do, they, the double blockade cells, do get input directly from, LGN or the retina, you know, from, from the thalamus, and And so that that all fit beautifully. So, okay, well, they're going to be defining what the minicom is. They're like the temple of the spatial pool algorithm would be between these double bouquet cells. They would then somehow enforce all the cells in that minicom to have the same response property. Albeit, Neil's objection, which is a good one, like, hey, it seems to be inhibiting them. Well, I don't know. We could figure that out later. But physically, it's the only thing that fit, right? It's the only thing. Another interesting thing that came out I just read recently, there seems to be just one double bouquet cell per minicom in the upper layer and the lower layer. And which is really interesting because that also makes it easier because just that one cell is going to determine the response problem as well as the 50 cells below it, or the 20 cells below it. So these are the kind of ways we work these things into the theory. Yeah. One thing I found interesting in this paper is that they talk about inhibition of inhibition. there, there's a whole section about inhibit, inhibitory, righton inhibitory, and they say, somewhere that, the basket cells are more interconnected than, double BK cells. So the double BK cells don't really inhibit, each other, that much. But the basket cells do. And therefore, I don't know what to make of that. I would think that, that I would want there needs to be, you know, if it's if it's a spatial pool, there has to be some.

way that the, that the double BK cells, do not all become active at once. You know, they have to have some sort of inhibition. And I think to be careful of when they say that this, there's more inhibition here, more inhibition there, they may be just doing it by the numbers. They may be just looking at how many synapses there are, which is a terrible way of doing it because You know, one strategically placed synapse can do everything, and, you know, 50 non strategically placed synapses may do very little at all, or they may be encoding some pattern or something like that, so you'd have to look carefully at those kind of data, that's my, what I've learned. Yeah, these cells are a lot more complex than I wanted them to be. Right, right. That's why I just say, you know, throw them into the bucket of, you know, regulatory functions, and then when we need something, we'll see if it's there to support our need. You know, this recent, recently I've had, you know, based on this idea that's going on in the grid cell literature, that the idea occurred that the cells in a minicom all have the same response properties, but perhaps they all have different phases. And that's something that, that grid cells require in some sense. And, and that, I've never heard anyone write about that or talk about it or test it or anything, which is a really interesting idea, that these double bouquet cells may not only be assigning each of these cells a, the same response property, but the, the, literally the propagation delays or something like that along those, the double bouquet cell axon, which is a slow cell. might be enforcing, the phase ship as you go, along the cells in the minicom. So that's a, this is another idea that came up in the last couple of years. yeah, because these double bouquet cells, they get their input from, also from the thalamus, just like, well, they do, but more importantly, you know, most, most of the cells in. say in V1, if you look at the upper layers, 2, 3 and 4, most of the cells are, respond to movement. They're not, you know, there are, layer 4 has a lot of cells that respond, are more static, but layer 3 cells are primarily, or many of them are movement sensitive cells. And the theory we have there is that they're actually detecting, they're doing, they're doing path integration, of, of components of an object, you know, like it's behaviors of an object. And that's the theory I've been working on recently. And so then if that were true, if they were like, if there was like another set of. passing integration around up in layer three, like you're trying to feel like, okay, I'm trying to learn the movement of the top of the stapler. I need to detect its movement and and know where it is. then then you would need these phase shifts up in the upper layers. And so maybe layer three cells will have base shifts in them, to do the, to do the, which is required for grid cells and path integration. So a lot of unknowns there, it's very speculative, but, but, you know, somehow this is all going to come together. and, and there's a situation, we know that the cell, that the cortex has to learn behaviors of objects. We know that that's part of the object's model. We know that these cells are movement sensitive, so that's probably what they're doing. I can't imagine what else they're doing that they're movement sensitive. We know that they're limited in their space and the layer three cells detect movements over small areas. so it all fits together nicely.

That was really a great review. Thanks, Jeff. Well, thanks. You picked it up and you wrote a lot of nice notes on it. I wouldn't have, I wouldn't have picked this paper to review other than you picked it. So, it's okay. It's a good opportunity if you want to get up on neuroscience, you can. Yeah, I feel like I'm missing a lot of the background. So, I wanted to pick a paper that, you know. Yeah, well, I thought it was a good way of doing sort of background neuroscience. And, and then I could talk about the basic ideas and what's, what's happening and how the, how the field has changed.

So I kind of enjoyed doing it.

Yeah, that was great. Thanks for suggesting that paper Rami. All right. That's all I have. And yeah, and the Slack channel, Rami, you post some interesting notes about how that might relate to some of the theory discussions we had lately. I don't know if you want to go more into those, or. I have some notes, but, I think we've covered a lot of them. Yeah. We covered a lot of those, I think. Yes. Yeah. I purposely didn't read your notes because I, I, I wanted to see.

I just didn't want to be biased by them, and I want to see if my take was similar to your take, or if I, maybe you Yeah, I also skipped a lot of the parts that they talk about Ion stuff, and all that. I skipped a lot of the things in the middle of the paper, and then I picked up, like, the later section. I felt like this was too much detail that I didn't need. It is, right? it's huge amounts of detail, and who knows if it's useful, but this, the tools they have, and they have these tools, and so they're going to use them, you know, outside of any kind of theory about what's going on, this is the best that they can do.

Yeah, I guess just one comment you had on Slack, Rami, which I'm not sure we really touched on, but it was just that, yeah, I think during one of the brainstorming sessions, Jeff, you were speculating about double bouquet cells. being not just responsible for kind of aligning receptor fields in layer four, but also elsewhere. And, I think Rami was just pointing out that, yeah, this paper supports that double bouquet cells are, I think in like every layer except for L6. And that they are in layer two, three, but also layer five in large quantities. Yeah, and then there was another paper I read recently, just recently, that said they only exist in layer 3. So, you just can't believe this stuff, you know? Well, to me it makes sense that you'd have, you'd be a set in the lower layers, and you'd be a set in the upper layers. And, you know, when they say, it's interesting, when they say they're only in layer 5, does that mean that their axons don't go to layer 6? Or is it that their cell body is in layer 4? Yeah, no, that's a great question, I'm not sure. I would be a little disappointed if it didn't go into layer six. Well, the idea that the double Bokeh cells may be assigning this sort of, phase shift to, that's required for grid cells would be nice to see that down in layer six.

so just like, you know, the, the double Bokeh cells in layer three project, you know, or two project to three and four. Yeah, they just say that they occur in layers two to five, but given their nature of their axons. It seems reasonable to expect that they would project down to layer six, but yeah, reasonable, but you're probably somebody knows it's just maybe it's probably written someplace. Yeah.

That's a good hypothesis. I mean, that's a, that's a prediction that we'd like to see that. If we didn't see it, I'd have to think, rethink that theory a bit, you know, anyway, I think from the point of Monty, of course, none of this is terribly important.

But it's helpful to be knowledgeable. In the paper somewhere they talk about late spiking cells, inhibitory cells. and I was wondering if, we've incorporated any of, any of those in our, in the theories of how, is that, is that, again, is that just means that the initial spike doesn't, it takes a long time? Yeah, so when they do the polarization step, it just, it takes a longer time to, to spike, for the initial spike. I thought Cs, I thought Double McKay cells had that property. Is that, is that not true? they, they, they refer to, lemme bring it up.

I think it's something called NGC or, oh, those are neuroglia, FORMM cells. Yeah. They said I didn't talk about those. Yeah. I think that they're in small quantities. I'm not sure these one right. There's these neuroglia form cells, which are like, hell, they are I the teen little cells, they don't ar ize much. Very little literature on them. yeah, and they said they, that they're, they exist in layers, two and, layers. Two, three, some layer five. They're so, so I'm not seeing any of your projecting anything. I'm not seeing it. there are so few, of the, there's so, there's so few literature about these neuroglia formm cells. yeah. And they have such a small spread of activity. I mean, they're really, I get the impression they're really small and they don't really extend very far. So, it's like. Maybe they're doing something else, you know, maybe they're like, you know, clean up functions or It could be like, you know You know just doing some housekeeping, but I don't know and they didn't talk about them much either in the paper That's just I mean if you if you want to sell the dude and have an important role in the cortex it's gonna have to form a lot of synapses of other cells and have some sort of, sort of presence of like, okay, this thing is connecting to all the axon hillocks and whatever, right? As opposed to like, oh, there's a little cell over here that just seemed to be, you know, sitting over there. I don't know. There's lots of other cells in your neural cortex. You know, there's, there's tons and tons of non neural cells. and some of them play important roles, but they're not generally information processing.

Just on the double bouquet cells, I would just had a quick look at, of course, the Thompson paper always. useful, but, I can just quickly share, but, I just keep hoping she's right, you know, because it's like, I mean, it's kind of like one of the only, like, anytime you Google anything about layer six, this paper always comes up, but yeah, this is 1981, like, just look at the data on that. Right. Okay. yeah, the, the sources, but this paper is 2010. I know, I know, but you decided to get social margin. Right.

yeah, just that layer four WK cells at least, project down to layer six. And I think this is what you were talking about, that it's fine unmyelinated axons. So that would be potentially slow, very slow. And then here, it's also described as slower dendritic inhibition may come from layer four WK cells to, to layer six. Yeah, so that's great. I I maybe I knew that maybe I didn't know it. I can't I think yeah When I looked at this, I remember us talking about this and I think that's where the earlier description like when you were saying about slow inhibition. I think that's where that came from. Right. I mean, it can be really slow. So, you know, the information it could, I mean, this thing, I wonder how fast we can look it up, how, how slow can an action potential travel on a thin, thin makes it slow and unmyelinated, it makes it slow.

if that could, you know, if it could take, you know, a theta cycle to you know, let's say 120 milliseconds to get from one end of one end to the other, you know, I'm saying, that number exists someplace. Yeah, there's this nice study. I'm just pulling it up of, it's actually from, birds, but they were looked at the conduction delays and these were local connections. Here we go.

yeah, conduction delays. And this is a long axon. Yeah. So, yeah, external conduction delays from the peripheral to hang on. That's from the peripheral to the CNS. Intercortical axons unmyelinated. Okay, let's, let's take the normal. It looks like, looks like, I would say that, oh, this is the, this is this, log scale. So that's like 0. 2. Is that right? That blue one. Intercort, intercortical axons unmyelinated. Let's, let's take that one. 0. 2 millimeters per second. So how far, per millimeter, per millisecond, how far would I go to see If I wanted to go, if I had, So, I mean, here they kind of do the calculation for you. Distribution of exonal path lengths and resulting conduction delays. And basically at the upper extreme, at the very upper extreme, and these are rare, is like 20 milliseconds. But you can see like a significant proportion go up to 7 milliseconds. Well, this is to go from where to where.

this is on the scale of, I guess, half a millimeter. Maybe. All right. So that's not enough. Really?

I mean, if I was trying to get a disperse, you know, if I was trying to get all phases of the cycle, which is maybe 8 or 10 hertz, let's say. Say a hundred, you have to go a hundred. you know, a hundred millisecond. So this is not, doesn't, yeah, I think there's no evidence for that. Slow, you know, it's interesting, those, those axons from the, I believe these axons from the chan, the double bay case cells go up and down, up and down. So maybe, maybe it doing a circuit, it's building on itself. I mean, I wouldn't put it outta the question. It's not, it's not impossible.

what would happen if you did something like that? You might have some interference pattern that, I mean, that's actually not a bad idea, actually. You know, imagine you, imagine you're, you have an accident, you have this action potential going down. Takes, you know, maybe it takes 10 milliseconds and then it comes back up again. It goes down again. You know, as those signals pass, they might be interfering. And you might get some sort of, the interference pattern could be much longer than the delay.

Yeah, where you just have some intermediary neuron. And then it's like a recurrent circuit or, or no, that goes back and forth a few times. I'm like's still synapses. I'm a cell, I'm a parametal cell, and, I'm getting multiple synapses from the same double queso. And they do, they get quite a few of, there's a number in there so those synapses could be formed not from, from different branches of the action passing by. And so when the actual synapse, when those actual synapses fire would be offset and in some, in some situations, they would be, they might align and you get, you know, it's, it's the same kind of oscillatory interference that you get with good cells. It might be. It might actually the delay that, yeah, I have to work it out, but I could see that there could be sort of a summation of these different delays that results in a, a much longer delay. I don't think about that, right? Something something's going to make it happen. So you can always guarantee that it's going to happen. So there has to be some mechanism to make it happen.

That's interesting. Again, from our theory's point of view, it's really cool and interesting, from neuroscience, pretty cool and interesting, but from a money point of view, it's not that important to understand that stuff.

That's interesting. That's a really interesting idea. Thank you. That's a good chart. What paper was that in? It's from this paper by Agar et al. It was a Neuron paper from, I showed it on the group, from, 2020, where, what do you call it? Oh, they were doing it for birdsong. Yeah, and so, so they basically claim that the axonal conduction delay serves like an important purpose to the spatial temporal sequences. But, you know, there's this big question, okay, this is in birds and it's in like a A part of their brain that's because it's what controls the pattern of their birdsong. So clearly time is very important. And so it might be something, I mean, there could be something similar. Yeah. Birdsongs aren't that short. I mean, so they have to have similar timing requirements that that might last, you know, 100 Oh, yeah. And actually, if I remember correctly, they also measure induction delays in rats.

I mean, if they're going to somehow explain bird song, they have to go from being something that's only a 10 millisecond delay to songs that, you know, are longer than that.

Oh, yeah. That makes more sense. Because I was going to say HPC premotor neuron, That sounds like mammalian stuff, but who knows? But anyways, yeah. So this is, this is. From rats amount of sensory cortex.

what's HVC? I don't want HVC.

HVC. Maybe that, maybe the HVC was the, the bird part. Sorry. And then the. I think the somatosensory is the well, that's right. It's going to go back to that. So there they have something there that's less than point. It's less than point two. Right.

I would avoid looking at a because that's like a logarithmic scale. I think they're just I know I'm reading off the reading off the logarithmic scale.

But I guess just, oh yeah, oh yeah. The path of the distance, one second. I think what they're, I'm trying to look, I'm trying to see a chart where it has the length and the delay, but I have the length and the frequency and delay and frequency, I'm not sure. So you have the delay here and the length, sorry, the length here and the delay here. I think the point they're maybe trying to make is that although the distribution of length is different between the species, The delays tend to be the same and tend to be long. So I guess they're arguing that, maybe that's like a conserved property or something. Yeah. But that's important. All right. Well, I don't know. HBC is a part of the bird's brain that's important for, so producing the songs,. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Well, I mean, verse songs are, durations of, you know, they can be, they're not super short.

so I have to have timing mechanisms that, that work for playing back sequences like that.

Yeah, and the paper is basically a combination of measuring these kinds of delays and then putting them in a spiky neural network model and showing that that, having these delays better explains the, the, the sequence produced than the without. The Birdsong mechanism is highly specific, right? Yeah, and it's and if I recall, unlike us listening to a melody, I can hear a melody faster and slower and I still know it's the same melody. I think birds are not like that. I think if you just tweak it, even the smallest amount, they don't recognize it. It's like, it's like really rigid.

so they're probably using different mechanisms than we do. Well, anyway, all interesting stuff. Oh, one more interesting statistics. I found it just before we go.

yeah, the, these, so when they're applying, balanced inhibition, this is under the section of balancing yin and, they talk about how the, the inhibitory, synapsis are different from excitatory, and they talk about how, the time course of inhibitory synapsis is about twofold longer than excitatory occurrence. They also talk about interneurons can discharge two to three times faster than pyramidal neurons. So then I think this goes back to the idea of fast spiking that Jeff was talking about. Yeah. the time course of inhibitory synaptic currents.

Oh. Well, I mean, if I want the synapse, if I want the inhibitory neurons to fire very quickly. What does that mean? The time course inventory? Is it longer? It keeps, keeps sending your transmitters for faster, like for longer time, until Oh, I see. It's not that it happens, it just happens. It just stays active. Yeah. Stays active longer. Right, right. They, they're trying to balance this with the, the, the idea that, the, the 16 of all synapsis on parametal neurons are inhibitory. So they're saying if they're only 16, then how can we balance it with inhibitory. synapses, but that's, that's a really crazy idea too, because this is ignoring the whole idea that, dendrites are active processing elements, right? If you think about, if you think about a dendritic tree, it's just like, oh, it's just summing the inputs from all these synapses. Then you could say that you could say like, well, there's not, you know, we have a lot of excitatory synapses, not as many inhibitors, so how can that be? But if you think about that's based on a very, very poor thinking about how dendrites work. If you think about dendrites as being, you know, it's active integration zones and the threshold of, of, of, local, dendritic spikes and that comment, then this concern goes away completely, you know, so, and this paper was written in 2004, so that's 20 years ago. But, yeah, maybe we can forgive them. I, I don't remember when people really started understanding, dendritic spikes, maybe it was around that time, but nowadays you would never write that, you know, cause we know that they're not just summation. Yeah. That makes sense. Right.
