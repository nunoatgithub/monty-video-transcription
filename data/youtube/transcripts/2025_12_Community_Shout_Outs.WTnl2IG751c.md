Viviane Clay: And again, I'll start with the shoutouts to the community. And... yeah, this month was pretty busy for me, and then took some PTO, so I actually haven't had a time to check this course the past two weeks, and so hopefully I'm not misrepresenting anything, missing stuff, but if I did, then I'll mention those people in the next month.

But yeah, we've had some more PRs from Agent Rev, who... finalize the simulator protocol cleanup, which I don't know if you remember, but during our Brighton retreat, Tristan and Will prototyped this on a separate fork of Monty, and then there was this issue here that the protocol should be reduced, and Tristan outlined a bunch of changes that would need to be made for that, and basically said, yeah, this is a lot of work, so don't feel like you have to sign up for all of it, but Agent Drive did sign up for all of it.

Jeff: Woohoo

Viviane Clay: And, completed it.

Jeff: Wow.

Viviane Clay: Yeah. this was the last PR that was merged a couple... last week, and yeah, I basically asked what's... what's next on the... on the map, and Tristan pointed out another related part that could be... could be done next, and there's already an open PR with that. So... Thanks a lot, for all these great changes. And for, yeah, still being interested. And yeah, just for those who enjoy these kind of things, like me, a short video of checking off this item. From the roadmap. There we go. Very satisfying.

Jeff: Is it...

Viviane Clay: Check things off.

And then, yeah, I also had some more PRs from MeiMe, reducing MyPi errors, and some refactoring.

And then a lot of PRs from Carver, there are actually two slides full of PRs, Basically around addressing rough linting rules and some fixes and refactors on various parts of the code. So thanks a lot for all those.

Jeff: Nice.

Viviane Clay: And then, yeah, after the community event, and also a few before, we had several new introductions on the forum. So, welcome to Daniel, Timothy, Bryce. To Ash and Andreas and Sergio, thanks for joining the forum and for introducing yourselves.

Really happy to see that you're interested. Oh, and more introductions. a phone from Janius and Avner. So, yeah, I think it was the month of new introductions on the forum.

And, yeah, if anyone else is interested, I think this is a great way to get started, to just kind of introduce yourself, your interests, and... If you're interested in contributing in any part of the project, or if you have questions, or a particular part you find interesting, that's a... A great way to get some pointers from the team and from other people on the forum.

And then, yeah, also a couple of first-time posts. Here one person sharing interactive visualizations. an interesting post around some ideas for modeling deformations. It was a problem we discussed in one of our research meetings about Deformation from circle to an egg and back, and how that could be modeled and learned.

You know, sharing a paper on our forum.

And... Yeah, another interesting, post that started in an email thread, and then... Nicely moved over to the forum, so everyone can follow along about... solid brain theory and, applying Monty to text understanding.

Interesting post around language and the mind.

And... Bryce shared a 6-minute explainer video condensing some of our video... longer videos into playlists. Another post around learning categories of objects, and some thoughts around, attention.

more interesting posts, some... a post from Agent Rev. with some ideas around, Monty.

a poster from Rich around predictive error processing and sensitivity, and some questions about references for grid cell papers in response to one of our videos about grid cells.

Then sharing the project, Zach, he's building a robot using Monty as part of his thesis. And he made a short 2-minute explainer video for one of his courseworks, and shared that video on LinkedIn. It's a really nice high-level overview of Feldenbrian's theory.

And then, yeah, sharing the project, there was also Mount Preet, who wrote a blog post about Monty. And shared it on LinkedIn, and then just, generally, sharing our meetup. Here Danish shared, picture of him watching Jeff's presentation from the meetup. For example. So yeah, thanks a lot also to anyone who's sharing the project and, or writing blog posts or producing videos around it. It's a really great way to help us. Spread the word.
