Yeah. Yeah. So I'll show around the setup while Will and Niels get everything ready. yeah, here's our, windows laptop that, communicates with the vibe trackers. The vibe trackers are set up down here. There's one I hope you can see, and then there's another one over there. And this is just strapping the tracker to the ultrasound device. So we can, this is indicating it's on, and then this is, connected to the iPad over here. It's a, it was sufficiently complex setup that we ended up creating like a surgical checklist that we would go through every time to make sure that everything is, is running well. We're setting up. Terry, do you have an object that you would like us to test on? Let's do the hot sauce. 'cause it has a different shape. Yeah.

And how, empty is the sauce? Hot sauce, nails, no comment. So you'll, right now you'll be seeing the, you can see the probe. Sometimes it gets a bit laggy when we're on Zoom, unfortunately, there's just, yeah, too many devices running, but the can probe moving relative. And then maybe if you switch over will to the other view. Yeah, on the top left you see the full ultrasound image, and then next to it you see the extracted patch and the features that we extracted. And then to the side of that, you saw, the relative locations in the world that it estimated.

and then on the bottom row you can see Monty's current hypothesis of what it thinks it is sensing. so there's still, almost all of the objects are still possible. The most likely hypothesis right now is Monte's heart. what did we actually put in change that? The hot sauce. Hot sauce. Okay. A see of a gold state. Gold state of huge. Oh yeah, not yet. Okay. Sorry. the ultrasound just needs a lot of jelly and fluid to, work any air and it doesn't say anything. We're not a hundred percent sure yet that all of the coordinate transforms are correct. Yeah, there's definitely a, so there might be some room for improvement. Yeah. It probably is the case that the coordinate transforms are totally right because this should be doable for Monte. Yeah. we just have a few more, like a few more observations. Oh yeah. Did we show the goal? Oh yeah. Here we go. Here's a good goal state. right now the probe is over here and the goal state is on the other side. So the user actually moves the Wow. Oh, okay. But the problem is we, yeah. Lost one of the trackers, unfortunately. Okay. You go. Okay. That's pretty close. Yeah, it's maybe if you rotate it will, so I can see. Okay. So once it goes into the actual point that the arrow disappears. So you see that once arrow, that's the arrow disappears, and then if you keep doing inference and get another goal state, then what you call it, it will, it'll do the same thing. It'll create a new arrow. It'll try and be a bit quicker.

You can see on the ultrasound image, like at the top, these like zebra stripes, like that's just one of the kind of artifacts that comes in and.

we have to are those reflections or something? There we go. And we finished. yeah, it's like bouncing back and forth and creating like a false image at a certain depth. So what did it categorize?

Monty's heart. Monty's thought. oh, that's a shame. Oh,
