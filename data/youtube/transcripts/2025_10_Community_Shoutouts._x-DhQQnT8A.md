Viviane Clay: yeah, as always, I'll start with a shout-out to the community. And today, I rearranged the slides, because we're getting more and more kind of substantial contributions, so I wanted to put those first, and make sure they are really highlighted. So yeah, they've been... Quite a few community PRs coming in this month. Here are a bunch of, PRs that came in from Mason, mostly centered around Adding rough, which is like a style formatting checker in the code, adding rules for that into the code that we were previously ignoring and making sure the code adheres to those.

And then... Yeah, quite some... nice work from Agent Rev coming in, so there was... Hang on, let me just, maybe open up... Yeah, We had shared the final presentations from the Brighton Retreat, and one of those was the attempted Python upgrade and kind of separation of the simulator. And so Agent Ref, took an interest in that and inquired a bit more of the repositories that Tristan and Willa put together for that. And what would need to be done? To take that work further, and the next step would be to integrate this simplified simulator protocol into Monty, and so he opened up an issue on GitHub. To get some more information, and Tristan... outlined a long series of steps that would need to be completed to do that. And, even ended that with. This is a lot of work, so please don't feel like you have to sign up for all of it. But, yeah. Adrian Ref said, I got this, I've done crazier back in the day. And, yeah, has started, working on this list of things, and already merged two PRs for two refactors, and there are currently two further open PRs.

yeah, slowly. Check, checking away on that. Topic? So thanks a lot. And I... since this is a bigger chunk of work, I also added an item on our future work table and put Agent Rev on there. thanks a lot.

And then Anna, who's been on our future work table. I've brought up in the past months already, is almost at checking off this item, actually, this... I think on Friday, or... I just approved this PR, so it's all ready to be merged, and this was the second big step. In refactoring the data loader and dataset into an environment interface, so she, nicely wrote out notes of what all had been done, running benchmarks, making sure everything still gets the same performance. Also made sure to go through the tutorials, updating all the figures in our documentation, making sure the tutorials still run. And, yeah, really put a lot of effort into this, and... Yeah, I'm super excited about it, because... Maybe I can... show the diff on some of this. It really does something I've been wanting to happen in Monty for years now, which is we initially started using, machine learning conventions talking about data loaders and data sets, but Monty doesn't work on datasets, it works in environments, and by interacting in environments. So we wrapped some code around that, but still used that naming convention. And now it's much clearer from looking at the code, how it's supposed to... Supposed to be, so before we had the data loader and dataset, and now that turned into the environment interface.

which Monty basically uses to interface with any kind of environment. So yeah, thanks a lot, Anna.

For making all these changes, and doing this nice refactor. And then just a couple of kind of cool projects that I've come across in the past month. This is only what people are sharing with us on the forum, so if anyone else has cool projects, feel free to share too. But yeah, here Spencer mentioned that he's working on integrating SDRs, from the... from HTM into Monty, and yeah, a couple days later, shared a GitHub repository. Yeah. basically, yeah, using SDRs, encoded for column-based AI subscribed as. So yeah, really interested where that work goes. And then, also, Joseph posted some, kind of sample code and questions around Making some changes to voting, and testing some multimodal voting. And yeah, there's been a lot of, back and forth, also with Niels and Rami giving some feedback on those ideas.

And then helping others, again, a big thank you to Agent Rev for, these are just some examples, but, answering people's questions on the forum. Here, someone had issues with running a tutorial, so quickly chimed in. with what the issue was, and linked to a recent video for another question about reproducing the LEGO robot setup. So yeah, thanks a lot. Then, yeah, good input, feedback, and suggestions. Rich Morin suggested mermaid support, which is a coding way to integrate diagrams into the posts, and so now that's supported on this course, thanks to Will enabling that. Someone else, proposed, yeah, some people that we could engage with, and... why this might be useful, and then Yitouk also recommended another podcast that Actually, Nomanta has been known before. So yeah, definitely, thanks for the suggestions. And also, on the video about the Q3 and Q4 objectives, Agent Raf made some suggestions around the... how to structure the future work, and how we might be able to use some of the GitHub features. Yeah, generally some really interesting discussions happening. for example, on the proposal to engage with some of these researchers, Agent Ref, Did, a detailed... Breakdown on how some of their work is different from what we're doing, and how it relates to our work. There was some interesting discussion around, Boating, cerebellum, on this thread, with Humble Traveler and Agent Rev, also, Rami adding... Some of our thoughts on that. So yeah, another interesting thread.

And then there was another thread about, whether Monty implements biological mechanisms for strengthening somatic connections between neurons.

There were a lot of other interesting posts. I'm just putting some examples here. There's one on a video about Learning sequences and behaviors.

Some thoughts around melodies, and how they could be modeled, and then here's some thoughts about pre-wiring connectivity.

Between different pixels. And then, yeah, a couple of first-time posts on this course, so welcome to this course community. Hope to see more from you guys. Yeah, people also sharing Thousand Rights Project on social media. Emma has been calling us out on several posts, or replying to people's posts. Just today, another nice post on LinkedIn about why reference frames are so crucial and important. Which I thought was a nice, description.

And then, yeah.

Michael writing something about, yeah, Thousand Sprints book, and... Yeah, how it's different and large language models. Hadi invited, Niels to... to present at the... Deep Learning, reinforcement learning debate series. And then, yeah, that was shared later, and... Also re-shared, so thanks. For everyone sharing that. Greg Robinson wrote another nice blog post about... yeah, different new types of AI, and... yeah, Thousand Brains Project also features in there, along with Meta's JPA, and Google's Genie, and other kind of new approaches that are coming up.

So yeah, thank you for everyone for all the great and various contributions. Really appreciated a lot.
