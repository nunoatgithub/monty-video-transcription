Okay. Are you guys ready? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So I'm going to, I'm going to present the prizes. we are, coming up with, we use five of the awards, and change one a little bit Viviane that you suggested. So first about makes the community happiest and we chose Willa and Tristan's project. we just thought it was. Amazing that you could forget about this too slow because we know you'll fix that. But once that's fixed, this is, making it easier to install and may making it mod is modular is really awesome. There's a lot of work that went into that. You guys had to do a lot to make that happen. Yep. okay. Second, we chose the most ambitious and we wanted to give a nod actually to Will and Tristan because what Jeff just said. We realized how ambitious that was to do that. But we, in the end are awarding this to Rami's project because it's amazing. He had to do this all by himself and also the presentation himself and managed to complete that. Did you sleep this week, Rami? Just checking. Yeah.

Okay, so that's most ambitious. the, next award is most exciting results and we thought that, that Scott and Ho J's results of the, Showdown Ska Showdown were amazing and there was really no caveats to those results. And, thought that was quite exciting. That could be just, looks like it could be just rolled in today, but, yeah. Yeah. Okay. And the fourth award we have is, most, we changed it from impactful to most essential for the team. and also the subtext is to keep the legend going. This was, Viviane and Niels and Jeremy of the, legend team, was quite, and this was a very ambitious project too, but we thought that what you guys are working on is really essential for the whole internal team and eventually the community to do compensate compositional objects. And you get, a little lot, you get some minor kudo points for finding bugs. But we didn't wanna have a separate, I mean look, will and tri this super amount of refractory. So that's, that's up there too. Yeah. No, no special word for bugs. okay, so finally, for best in show and most entertaining presentation, we talk, this is why we're a little late. We were talking about this in the end, we're awarding this to two teams. 'cause there's two, two overall trophies. that's Will and Tristan's team and, Scott and Ho J's team for. and Right, so all four of these were quite amazing you guys. Yes. Do amazing work in, a week. not only did you present well on those two teams, you al also had slight little slight gags, which made us lot happy. You had the, peer programming and you had cowboy spam. Those are both entertaining, so we'll give it a little side shout out to that. and they were a lot more interactive with one of them showing the code running and then the other one was showing the different highlighted areas on the dog and not, so just a little bit more interactive to, to keep, non-technical people engaged.
