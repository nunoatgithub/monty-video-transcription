every intelligent system human or animal learns by interacting with the World We Touch look around move actively test hypotheses and explore our environment this is called sensory motor learning and it's how we understand the world we often hear that modern artificial intelligence is inspired by the brain but the truth is current AI is very different current AI systems don't learn through active interaction with the world they're trained on massive static data sets like being shown a photo album without ever touching or exploring the objects in the pictures or reading all the texts on the internet without knowing what the words refer to at their core they are just strong pattern recognizers humans learn in a much more flexible efficient and robust way we don't need thousands of examples to learn something new think of how quickly a child can learn a new word or how you can perform a new task after watching someone just a few times we also don't stop learning once we finish a specific task we always absorb new information and refine our knowledge imagine machines that could learn like we do that interact sense and adapt in real time this could solve many real world challenges where internet scale data isn't available or quick adaptation is required this is what the Thousand brains project is all about at Numa we spent many years studying the brain and figuring out the principles underlying our intelligence now we're building an open source AI framework that runs on these core principles it's a fundamentally different approach that will change the way we think about AI
