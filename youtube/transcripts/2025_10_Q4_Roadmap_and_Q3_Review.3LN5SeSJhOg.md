So view of September years going by fast end of Q3 already. So we're gonna do the Q3 review as well, at the end of this. yeah, but I'll start with the shout out to the community. And yeah, it's been pretty exciting. I feel like there's more and more happening and more and more kind of collaborations and significant contributions and interesting exchanges on the forum. So yeah, this is getting really fun to put together these slides. so first of all, some first time posts, new people joining the forum, Ram, from the University of Groaning and in the Netherlands introducing himself and asking, some questions. and then also paper docs, and yeah, asking about time series, pattern, recognition and time series. But then there are also a couple of other posts from him and even a pr, that I'll show in a bit. So yeah, welcome to the forum, and the project. And then, yeah, there were a bunch of interesting posts just, to, to highlight. there were, yeah, a couple of papers shared. For instance, here, DLA shared a paper on, yeah, with a current models have an understanding of physics or they can just, generate impressive visuals. and then, yeah, another interesting paper shared around, yeah, robotic manipulation and how it helps to provide point, cloud data or predict point cloud data, some discussion around those. and then, yeah, hear another interesting thread, started by pep docs around, how learning in Monty works algorithmically. I.

Yeah. in the category of helping and interacting with others. I think the award this month has to go to Agent Rev. He's just been, really helpful answering people's questions, replying to people who share other people's, like other articles and research, and how it relates to Monty. giving feedback on the workflow, for doing research with Monty.

yeah, replying to different articles about researchers doing alternative approaches to ai and then yeah, TBP based projects and plans. Zach has posted again, this time posting a bit more of a concrete. Outline of a potential undergrad project using Monty for an application in robotics. and then here was another post, I think it was Spencer. Yeah. posting about, implementing a, custom learning module using SDRs and some proposals around that. And yeah, said she started to implement an SDR based learning module and we'll share some visualizations once things are working. So looking forward to that. And then also, Sebastian asking about some more details on our previous investigations into integrating HTM into a learning module and yeah, saying, yeah, sure, it's a monumental task, however, I'm still interested. So yeah, maybe also looking into that, which would be cool to see. then yeah, we had a couple of community prs this month. some fixes to the documentation, some, mostly link path fixes. then yeah, PR from Paper Docs, updating the environment to allow MKL, dependency for Mac Intel. nice PR from Agent Rev. adding a WSL tutorial for setting up monon subsystem for Linux Windows subsystem, which he previously shared on the course, but now it's integrated into our documentation. and then another peer from POCs, fixing a path assumption. and yeah, those were the kind of smaller ones, but still really, nice and helpful ones. So thanks for those. And then, we also had some contributions to our overall roadmap, which are often like quite big chunks of work. And, you can see like each of these items, is a bigger chunk of work and the kind of icons show what peer people both on our team and in the community are currently working on. And so one really nice example of someone contributing to a, an item on this roadmap, this month was from Anna, who first yeah, posted on, this course about how she can, contribute in the intro thread. And then we had scoped out potential options and then an action plan of different steps to, make it happen. And then, continually interacted on here with questions and progress on this item of combining data load and dataset into an environment interface. And basically working on a, really nice. pull request refactoring Monty to slowly look a bit more like an actual embodied system instead of, an AI that learns from a static data set. And this PR was merged, last week, where yeah, she merged the data load and data set into, one class and updated all the respective, calls of those and configs and even added some more unit tests. so yeah, really great, PR contributing to our roadmap. So thanks a lot Anna, for this one. And, another one working on, another item on our roadmap is Colin working on adding GPU support. So we have a GPU working group now. and this is, this are the first two videos of our new Community edition video series. two meeting recordings of Colin and Tristan meeting and talking about how we could add GPU support to Monty. and, there are also meeting notes in this course. from that, then Greg Robinson has written some more nice, blog posts, the theory of mind, on humor, and then also shared previous blog posts I think that I had in last month's presentation, on this course. So those are really nice reads if you, are looking for something to read. and then other people have also been sharing thousand Brains project on social media, responding to, people talking about AI and whether LLMs are the path or what's, what is the path to real intelligence. the first time I think that Grok mentioned Brains Project, someone asking it what's. Monty, and, the ex AI agent giving a summary of our project. yeah, here another person sharing our, paper about Monty and what it can do. and yeah, another one, commenting on a post about, like a definition of intelligence and referencing Jeff's definition in the Thousand Brains book. and yeah, I hear another kind of thread about, LLMs and Monty and, learning through interaction with the world. yeah. thanks a lot for everyone sharing the project, right? posting on the forum and contributing to our code base. It's really exciting to see. and yeah, hope the trend continues and I'm excited to see, everyone who's everyone's projects, everyone who's forking Monty to see what, they're doing with it eventually. Okay. goals that we set out for ourselves or priorities that we set for the past three months, were mirror mirroring the TVP mission again. So we have, this was mostly a research priority, enabling Monty to model composition objects accurately and efficiently. then this was a bit more on the engineering side. make Monte easy to use, improve, and contribute to. both for us and for the, for external people. then increase external interest and awareness of our approach. And lastly, on the theory side, figure out how to model object behaviors in brain, in the brain and in Monty. And so specifically subgoals we had there, for the, for modeling composition objects, one of the subgoals was to have a data set training and inference protocol and evaluation measures to ev evaluate MA's composition modeling abilities. And we got a huge chunk of that done during the, focus week. We already had the data set from Scott, and then yeah, basically implemented the training and inference protocol, the supervision for it, the evaluation measures, and evaluated Monty. and then, yeah, a little bit more of cleanup and getting it ready to integrate into TBP of Mon TBP Monty in the kind of weeks afterwards. so it's light green, which means a bit of follow-up work left 'cause it still needs to be merged into Monty, but, it is all there.

then, oh, I put that in the wrong spot. I, improved, let me move this thing, but, okay. Improved hypothesis resampling based on different signals. based on prediction error out of reference frame movement, salient features, confidence manifesting as improved or comparable accuracy on composition data sets with reduced computational overhead. So a lot of work went into this one. there was, work from. Both, Rami and Hojae, scoping out kind of approaches for this in, different RFCs HO J'S RFC actually split into three RFCs. and then there's this, feature branch that Rami has been working a lot on over the past months, and j has been testing the auto reference frame movement, which IMARK has done now because we decided to not integrate that right now. But we have a nice writeup of all the results. but yeah, so a lot of work went into it, but it's not, none of it made it into Tbp Monte yet, and we don't really have final results on improved accuracy, for this one yet.

then SIC policies improve accuracy on composition data sets and enable sparse models. so Scott worked a lot on this and then also Jose during the focus week. so we have, Scott implemented the Cade policy moving to Gold States, a lot of plumbing into Monty for sensorimotor modules, emitting gold states and adding the gold states selector, adding the inhibition of return and then testing different saliency methods and evaluating them against each other, and also learning sparse models. So yeah, this kind of showed approved accuracy, and all that, but again, it's light green because it's not integrated into TBP Mon yet.

Then, add and test it to the surface sensorimotor module enable enabling improved representation of 2D on 3D compositional objects. Jose got started on that last week. There's a, nice feature branch there. Some first, results on it. But, yeah, this one is still, early in progress.

make much easy to use, improve and contribute to. We had, motor systems disentangled from other classes, but that one got, superseded by other things that came up, like a lot of, platform planning. so there wasn't a lot of progress on this one. then Monte's not constrained to Python 3.8, which, Jeremy is working on. It's still in progress, but there was. several PRS merged and also, changes that are currently in progress on this one. Basically the approach currently being to, integrate MUCO as a different simulator, which allows us to upgrade Python. we briefly had a much higher Python version during the focus week, with the other approach that, Tristan will implement it, that's not the current main path. and then added interactive and up-to-date overview of where people can contribute. that one also, there's a lot of progress and basically, will implemented all of this already, but it's currently under review. so hopefully it will be live very soon. And then improved documentation on how to contribute and how to customize Monty for specific applications. That was a bit of a vague one, but there have been several prs both on adding, or hackathon projects as examples. and then also just general improvements to the documentation, adding some more cross links and, information on using Monty and how Monty works and how to contribute, and do research with Monty, increase external interest and awareness of our approach. one of the big items was to publish all the material around how hierarchy and DMC papers and produce it. So Will has, yeah, recorded and edited and produced all of the kinda shorts for the DMC and hierarchy paper and the full length videos. And, there are two blog posts, with the plain language explainer on our website now. so that one is done and the shorts are being gradually released, but all ready in the pipeline.

and then presented TBP and, TBT and Monty at several conferences. And speaker series, I marked it as screen 'cause there was, again, a bit more vague, but we haven't really presented it much, but attended several conferences and then lined up several presentations for the next, weeks and months. but that's a, an always ongoing thing. but yeah, made good, kind of progress and yeah, organizing an online community event, hasn't happened yet this quarter.

And then on the theory side, One of the items was, was a proposal for open questions around object deformation and actions. We haven't really gotten into talking about that too much the past months, but hopefully we will in the next months. And then concrete writeup or prototype of how to model object behaviors in Monty, I put together a presentation and then, a writeup in the Google doc of the exact concrete steps of, what we would have to do to get these different capabilities that we need for modeling object behaviors. and so planning to also integrate that in our public documentation, hopefully this week. But yeah, we have a pretty concrete writeup of that now.

so yeah, overall. I think we did a decent job on the priorities. yeah, several things that like a lot of work went into, but there's still some follow up work to do, especially to integrate things into Monty. and but yeah, we've worked on almost everything on there and made good progress on almost everything on there. okay. But then, yeah, I'll briefly go over the Q4 priorities that, Tristan Niels will and I put together.

so again, I put the mission on the left side and the priorities on the right, and they follow a similar pattern as the last two quarters. so first this is, was, basically a continuation of the first priority last month. last month. we gave monthly the ability to model the composition objects and we can evaluate its ability to model composition objects now. So the next quarter is really about improving Monte's ability to model compositional object. Both accurately and efficiently. And so there are a couple of kind of research lines that go into that. basically, yeah, taking the baseline metrics we have now and improving on them, getting Monte better at modeling composition objects. That's the big theme for the research, I would say in the next quarter. Then making money easier to use, improve and contribute to. I'll go into the sub points for that in a moment. increasing external contributions to the project.

and theoretical progress on how to utilize behavior models. So this one is again, a bit of a con continuation of the previous one, but it's a slightly different word. So I feel like now we have a pretty good idea of how we want to model object behaviors. And so this one is focusing more on how we then use these behavior models, for example, for actions and also to make predictions about, like what to see.

so yeah, let me go through what goes into these. So multis ability to model composition objects. one part that goes into that is the model free and model based Cade policy that Scott has been working on. so the gold state generation of sensorimotor module saliency, go state selector and CIC policy are all validated and integrated into TP Monte. So that will be probably several integration projects. getting that all into the main code base, then dynamic adjustment of the hypothesis space that, Rami has been working on a lot. it is validated and integrated into Tbp. Monty should probably also be several integration projects.

then the Composition Object Test Bed and Metrics is integrated into TVP Monty. That's the kind of PR I opened, last week.

and yeah, tested additional ways to improve performance on compositional test bed. there's this 2D sensorimotor module that Hojae is working on, potentially masking or seg segmenting, in the sensorimotor module. In addition to saliency hypothesis. Re-anchoring is an idea we talked about adding the top-down connections will be an important one. storing the child relative to parent orientation is another piece of plumbing that needs to be added into Monty. And then, yeah, hyper parameters and I expect us to be running lots of experiments in the next month.

figuring out how to get best model these, compositional objects, making Monty easier to use, improve, and contribute to. this one might look a bit familiar. So here is, the MO motor system is in disentangled from other classes right now. There's a lot of kind of messy entanglement between the motor system and data loader and dataset, which are now one class, but still a lot of entanglement. and Tristan has been working on that one. and then Monty's not constrained to Python 3.9, which, Jeremy's working on with the Muco integration. And also, integrated with simulator runs on Windows as well as distributed via instead of Conda. both also ties into the MACO integration that Jeremy's working on. and then for increasing, so increasing external contributions to the project itself is not very concrete. It's a bit partially outside of our influence, but we have a couple of, concrete points that we want to do, to hopefully achieve that. so one is to, get the future work table live and then for us to update the research engineering and community items, and the meta data metadata associated with them so that everything is up to date, people can easily find different projects that require different skills for different interests in that interactive table. And it's easy to find a place where someone could contribute if they want to.

fostering the community engagement and collaborations, that's the kind of ongoing things like Penn State, IDPR community members. publishing more resources on Monty and the project. So that involves both like the DMC and hierarchy paper being published in the journal. So we need to address the reviewer comments for that and resubmit the DMC paper. But then also, more video releases, documentation, updates and speaking opportunities.

then lowering the barrier to find information and contribute. So kinda figuring out what's the path people take, what kind of information are they looking for, and how can we make it easier for them to find that information?

and organizing and hosting a community event.

And then lastly, theoretical progress on how to utilize behavior models. One, a proposal on how to use behavior models to make predictions about mythology, including distortions and a proposal on how to use behavior models to inform actions.
