So, uh, it's the beginning of Q2, so the next three months. And so I asked, um, Will, Tristan and Niels for some input on what our priorities for the next three months should be. And here's what we came up with. So first of all, um, Tristan made this really nice analogy of how they, uh, align with our mission. So I'll start with that one. Um, so here's our, our mission. Um, create core sensorimotor algorithms scattered by neuroscience. Create open source platform for creating sensorimotor pro products and increase awareness of sensorimotor technologies for AI and robotics. And so our Q2 priorities line up pretty nicely with those. So the first one is, uh, creating the algorithms, which here are priority for the next three months is to pave the way for mon to model compositional objects. And I'll talk in a moment a bit more concretely about what kind of things we wanna do for that. Um, second, uh, we wanna make Monty easy to use in a variety of applications currently with a focus on the TBP team because we are the biggest user of Monty at the moment, and we don't have a platform yet. And we are the best judges right now of how easy it is to use. Um, but this is just for the next three months, the focus. And then, um, on increasing awareness. We wanna increase, um, engagement, but particularly academic engagement with the project. And then we have a fourth one that doesn't map on this. Um, but I think it's still very important. It kind of maps maybe on the first one as well, which is, uh, figure out how to model object behaviors both in the brain and Monty. So that's kind of the core research, like understanding the theory part of it.

Um, so does that make sense for everyone as priorities? Okay. So the idea is we have these year concise priorities, and then whatever we work on in the next three months should kind of contribute to one of these four things. Um, and so concretely what we're. Thinking, um, for the years. Uh, so now this is kind of the results we wanna see at the end of the three months. Um, so for number one, paving the way to model composition objects, uh, we wanna have, um, the accuracy on the unsupervised inference benchmark that Ramy set up to dramatically improve. Um, probably using the hypothesis resampling that, uh, rami's planning on the speed of inference for the distant agent, uh, to dramatically improve, uh, via better policies even in the absence of the hypothesis testing policy. So that's kind of a Cade policy that we've been talking about. And then have a test bed set up for compositional objects. So logos on cups is what we're currently thinking, um, and have that. Test bed available and performance of baseline, Monty of two hierarchically stacked learning modules quantified on there. Um, this is just the test bed, so not like expecting it to solve it perfectly yet.

And then lastly, uh, the MORTAR system, uh, should support swapping out policies, which will be important for, uh, the policy work. Uh, um, here we making Monte easy to use in a variety of applications. Uh, we want the motor system to be disentangled from other classes. That's a bit of what we talked about in the previous coding.

Um, Monty not being constrained by Python 3.8. Um. And publishing tutorials on Monte and novel applications and robotics, plus several example projects that will be, um, the outcome of the hackathon.

And then for increasing academic engagement, the plan is to contact, uh, at least 20 universities created five pieces of content targeting university PhD, master students. Um, we ensured all available all, yeah, all of us have booked, booked to go to a conference in 2025 to have some actual face-to-face engagement with people. Um, adding 500 academic contacts on Twitter, blue sky, uh, releasing 36 hours of video on YouTube and publishing two articles in peer reviewed journals. That's the DMC paper and the hierarchy paper. I. And then on the, uh, object behaviors theory side of things, we would like to have a concrete proposal for generalizing the stapler behavior to another object. So applying a behavior from one, um, morphology to another and predicting those are features. Um, a concrete proposal for how object behavior models could be implemented in Monty, and then filing a provisional patent application, or alternatively a public disclosure writeup.

Um, all of these, there's a document I can share the link with you in Slack later. Um, all of these are in a, in our shared Google Drive. And then there are, um, sub team objectives, um, in here as well that I'm not gonna go through in detail right now. Um, basically like. The sub teams. So research, engineering and communications set three priorities for the next month that each align with those, uh, comp with those, uh, companywide priorities, um, and kind of the measurable outcomes for those. Um, so if you, if you're wondering like, oh, I'm on the research. What, what are we gonna take care of out of these things I just talked about? Then this might be a good, good place to look. And just generally, um, this is meant to be a bit of a north star for you today, tasks to make sure that whatever you're working on kind of contributes to our, uh, main goals for the next three months and, um, aligns with these priorities. Does that make sense?

Yes. Any questions?

Cool. Then yeah, made this kind of first half of 2025 timeline, um, in February. Talked about it during the retreat, and this is how it looked back then. And I just made a couple of adjustments to it. So now we are here. Um, basically we extended the two, the work on the two papers, uh, a little bit longer. Um, hoping to finalize that by the end of April. And then I made a few minor adjustments on, on this, this one extending the test bit, work a little longer, and starting the learning module work a little earlier. Um, there's been a bit of overlap between the two and then policy work starting at a little bit later. Um, and yeah, we, we split up the benchmark automation into part one and part two. Part two is currently not, uh, scheduled on here. Um, and then we have a new one that wasn't on there before, which was making the DMC papers were experiments reproducible. So turning, uh, Monty into a package, putting out a condo, making a template repositories and moving code over there. Um, and it's still ongoing. Um, and then we have, uh, the task of making policy swappable, which was actually previously we had this one first and then the second, but now switch the order of the two. Um, and then we have a, a first trial of, um, doing a, a Python and habitats date, uh, figuring. Um, trying to get it to work with Monty and have habitats and work with a newer Python version. And, uh, it's unsure if that will be possible in that kind of time boxed week or not. And that will, uh, determine a bit on what next steps will be, if we will decouple more from habitat or, um, yeah, that those boxes are bit, uh, dotted because it depends a little bit on how difficult that will end up being.

Um, and then how these actually map onto the priorities. We have the one, uh, pick the composition objects one, which uh, includes these, um, green milestones, so the unsupervised learning prerequisites part, hopefully completed by then. And then also the test bed part of composition objects and making the policy swappable here on the engineering side. We have making Monte easy to use in variety of applications, which includes the hackathon work and then also the refactor, the data loader and the kinda habitat people and update.

And then increasing academic engagement includes both. Um, a lot of the work that Willis doing with the outreach, um, but also the two papers working on, um, and lastly, figuring out object behaviors. This, um, this brainstorming work down here.

Does that, uh, make sense?

I think the one the, I think I kind of missed or whatever was just the, um, the chain doing the make policy swappable earlier now rather than the refactor. Um, I mean, I think that, I guess makes sense in terms of, uh, priorities and stuff, but maybe that's something that's worth. Like discussing, uh, I don't know. Uh, and it could be later, but just whether it might be hard to do that without the refactor. Um, I, I think it might be actually easier, like, like all the complexity will still be there, but you'll just be able to swap the policies out. But everything's still talking to everything else. I just, I was, yeah. Right after doing planning and staring it for a while, like, we actually might be able just to do this.
