Welcome to our YouTube channel. I'm Viviane Clay, director of the Thousand Brains Project. For the past 20 years at Numenta, we've been trying to reverse engineer the neocortex based on what we know from neuroscience. And about three years ago, we felt like we crossed the threshold where we could start building a system based on these principles. Since then, it has been an internal project at Numenta. In June 2024, we got a grant from the Gates Foundation, and we decided to make the project fully open source. As part of that, we want to start releasing our meeting recordings again, as Numenta used to do. Besides the current meeting recordings, we also want to publish our past meeting recordings, to give you some idea of how we got to where we are today. This is no small feat. We have over 200 hours of meeting recordings. As we sorted through these recordings, we decided to group them roughly into three categories. First, we have core meetings. These are more polished presentations and key milestones in the project's development. At the beginning of each video, I'll give you a quick introduction with a bit of context that you might need to follow along smoothly. Second, we have brainstorming meetings. Those are pretty unpolished, unedited, and they give you a chance to be a fly on the wall of our research meetings. And third, we have review meetings where we go through other people's research and review topics related to this project. We'll start posting videos in these three categories on a regular basis from now on. Let us know what you think of this organization and also just comment on any other feedback you have or content that you would like to see. Also don't forget to subscribe to this YouTube channel so you get notified when we post videos and follow us on social media like Twitter or LinkedIn. Looking forward to seeing you soon. Cheers
