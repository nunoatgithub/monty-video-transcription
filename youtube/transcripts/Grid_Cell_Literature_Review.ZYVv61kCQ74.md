Yeah. the agenda for today's meeting is probably about an hour or so. I will go over some, I guess the ba from basics to some recent literature in grid cells. So it's a broad area. and the, rest of our time, Jeff has, something to present, about how movements are created. I don't think I'm remembering the whole thing, which I guess happens to also cover grid cells, so that seems like a unfortunate coincidence. They're very related. Very related. And, just to interrupt you before you even get started, OJ this good cells are one of the hardest topics I've ever dealt with in neuro, and, I'll try to, my advice. So if you find this confusing, then you're in, don't worry about it. If you don't find it confusing, then I'll worry about myself. But, but, when I first really dove into grid cells, it was probably two months before I had a decent understanding of what's going on. And it was like, it is really confusing. if, oh, okay, great. Because in the middle I, I wrote one sentence, I was like, this is so obvious. And then I thought about it and I was like, this is very not obvious. and I'll point it out there. it might be easier for you, but it wasn't just me at Mente, it was, it was Hai, myself and a bunch of other people all just scratching my heads over this so long as unbelievable, but it's understandable. Okay. Sorry, I just, didn't wanna sort preface that it's difficult. Oh, yeah, no worries. And, also yesterday I was mostly at urgent care, so my brain is a little bit Oh yeah. You okay? But I, yeah, I'm much better, just, like a 24 hours food poisoning. but yeah, after sleep, I'm, so much better. So we're good to go. Basically.

Yeah. Wow. Yeah. Glad to hear you're feeling better. Yeah. Yeah. I think that, yeah, like yesterday night I was like, seriously considering oh my goodness, can I do this? Can I not do this? And then it was like a good night's sleep. I still haven't eaten yet, but, it's, you'll see like Arthur is here, but I have a banana, and he really wants that banana, but it's minor there. It's like mom's first food in 20 hours, so he cannot have a banana. Okay. Anyways, that, that's too much rambling. we can just, probably cut that part and start the recording from your, will, okay. So literature review on grid cells, the, short table of contents, I will go over like a grid cell one-on-one. I think things that I think most people can agree on, I would say. and then, middle portion will be dedicating to re anchoring of grid cells. So this is it's still a literature view, but, inspired from the fact that I, Anil and I are working on this, implementation, request for comments RFC on, how to handle re-anchoring in Monty and what to do with, off object observation. So that, that was part the actual motivation for doing this grid cell literature review, and some recent work. by recent, like from 2022 and, since then, the reason why I also mentioned that year, okay, grid cells gonna one, is that, there's actually, if you search for grid cells on YouTube, Menta has a whole. Basically course about it. there's so many videos from the channel Numenta theory that I wanted to, include. a lot of them are like these, kind of research meetings that are like an hour or an hour and a half. I, did not watch all, plenty videos. It's just FYI, and, there's also, I think one of the best resources for Getting Up to Speed is watching this, 2014 Nobel Prize and Physiology of Medicine. the lecture has been, I think they record all the lectures and put it on YouTube, but, basically this is like a three hour-ish lecture from the No Friday winners, John O. Keith, neighbor Mozer, and Edward Moser on, play cells, in grid cells. but in general, so I, I think these resources are gonna go, some of them are gonna go into like much more detail definitely than what I will cover today. but I just thought that for people like me, I need something that is I wanted to make something that was like very accessible to the community for somebody who may not even be in systems neuroscience, even though this is, as Jeff said, like a very difficult topic to gr.

and, it goes also saying that we don't have to implement, I don't expect we'll ever implement the details here of Good Cells in, in Monty. That's right. it's very detailed, cellular biology, and we don't generally want to do that if we don't have to. yep. You understand, mostly for yeah. Inspiration about what happens when grid cells do rein. so we just want, I guess I was curious on what's the biological justification for, doing something, or, doing this in Monte. so we don't need to follow the biological mechanism, but at least, in the beginning I wanted to know if there's any connection at all. Okay. So before I can even, talk about Chris, I wanna just have one slide, on three cells. I'm sorry. I'll keep noticing Hojae. I'm sorry about this, but it's more than that. many of the ideas in Monty we wouldn't have thought of if we didn't read about grid cells, of unique locations in space. The re-anchoring, how shapes, there's a whole bunch of concepts that, that we, all we knew is going into It was like, Hey, we have to have some representation of location and therefore some reference, but we didn't understand path integration. We didn't understand this RY anchor. We didn't understand unique representations of location. So it's more than just oh, these are things we got from stunning grid cells. So it's, it was pretty important.

And those one. Yeah. Yeah. It's more kind of, I guess this is why we're revisiting this topic. 'cause as you say, Jeff, it underpins a huge amount of the thousand brains theory, but in terms of why are we talking about today, it's more because, yeah, we're starting to add, we're planning on adding certain properties to how the locations are updated in Monty. Like things like re-anchoring, and yeah, when you move off of an object, which would be analogous to like removing a mouse from an environment and things like that. Yeah. So it just seemed worthwhile to just revisit the literature, see what actual grid cells do in those kinds of settings. does that co like correspond to what our interests were for what we would wanna implement? Are they different if they're different? Is there something interesting there to think about? so that, that's why, Yeah. which is doing this today. Sounds good. Yeah. Great.

Okay. Yeah. like a.

I will just cover one slide about play cells. and I'm gonna, show you this video, but, this video has no, no sound to it, but basically what you just orient people, what you're gonna see is a mouse with a electrode, implanted on head that is running around this box square environment. and, basically you're gonna see these kinds of like black lines as, indicating the mass trajectory and then some, colorful dots where the cell, whatever the cell is firing.

and yeah, the different colors is correspond to different cells.

Okay. It looks like it, the original recordings only recorded from one cell. I could see the red on the black. Yes. Yeah, I was gonna say, I, I couldn't find the original video. I think it was a little bit too far ago. but yeah, so yeah, but the idea is very similar to what happened in the original video, except this one has 10 simultaneous recordings going on, instead of just one. And of course, like once, if you try to make like a, like a common way that these are presented in papers, this is, firing rate heat map. So the size of the heat map is the same as the size of the room. And wherever you see red is where there was a high firing rate of that cell. and blue is where, where there's, less, and of course, it, it's, for one cell it's a little bit easy to visualize for, multiple. It's, difficult. You, it, Cut of blood together. But, but that's general idea. so place cells seems to fire at locations, regardless of any ary input. So that was the, so this was like telling the location, hence the name, place cells, of the animal. and this might seem like a random fact, but it's okay, cool, we found this cell. But I think the fact that's like a little bit less appreciated is that it seems to be like one kind of independent from sensory inputs. And this is what John Keith mentioned in his Nobel Prize lecture is that, it seems to be generated within the brain itself. and, this was, I'm, mentioning this because, this was the motivation for looking for grid cells in the first place. Oops.

and let's see if we can go to the next slide somehow. Okay. There we go. So I think it's worth pointing out a few things here. If you go back to the previous slide, first of all, the cells always been fire in the same locations, in the same environment, but if the rat perceived it as a different environment, the cells would fire in different locations. Yes. So it wasn't, like these are the locations in a square, these are the locations in this room. And if you put a painting on the wall in the room and the rat felt was a different room, a painted placard, then the good cells would remap and it would be in a different location. Yep. the play cells would remap. Yeah. And the idea that the generating the brain itself, so it does require a visual input or some sort of input to know what environment it's in. But if you turn the lights off and the rat moves around in the dark, the play cells still fire. Which is the concept of path integration. so at times you don't need sensory input. Once you've locked into this room, you know what room you're in. then the cells will continue to fire as you move about, even though there's no sensory input. But it's not completely independent sensory input because the rat has to determine where it is in the world. Yeah, That's why I was like, it's a little bit Okay. I just, wanna add some flavor on top of that. Yeah, definitely. I think we'll definitely also cover that, and re-anchoring 'cause Oh, no, This is, I think I, again, I think I meant just say it. that's all. You don't, I'll, I'm, just gonna add call. Please view. No, just keep going. yes. There. Okay. I don't wanna want this to keep playing. Okay. It will, do these cells have different scales, like we have in grid cells? Because I can see some cells are the firing ranges like a larger scale and others are like smaller. Do we know if they have different scales or, does anybody wanna take this up? Yeah. Okay. I know that it's true in grid cells, I believe it's true in place cells as well. whereas, as you go across, these are all in hippocampal complex. And as you move across from one direction to the other, the, scales of these things jump. and, I believe the play cells scale jumps with the, with, the same as the grid cells. I'm not a hundred percent certain, but like 95 certain about that. But you don't see 'em mix, you don't generally see 'em mixed up, the play cells and the grid cells in one little area are soon to be the same scale, I believe. it's also, it's a bit misleading because you think, oh, this one cell just encodes this one space. But of course, these cells are reused and in larger environments, they can be active in multiple places, and of course they can be active in other environments. it's like nothing in the brain is a single cell grandmother cell. And that's true here too. Although at certain scales and certain environments, it looks like one cell responds to this one location in this one environment. Yeah. Yeah. A good question. so this discovery replace cells in 1971. if were to kinda follow the idea that, this is somewhat, at least somewhat independent of sensory inputs and seems to be one generated from, from the brain itself. then, where are these like play cells and how are they generated? So that was the next natural question. And there's a lot of series of experiments that led up to this, but basically the idea was that instead of looking at, so I think the original place hall was recorded in ca one of the hippocampus. and so the mos I think their, graduate advisor I think was Perry Anderson. And then I think per, per one of his work was, trying to figure out the hippocampal like enteral cortex, circuitry. there is a simplified version. I don't think this is actually the entire circuit by any means. But, oh, sorry. sorry, go ahead. I wasn't seeing your screen anymore, but I just switched to a different tab. Sorry. Oh, okay. That's fine.

basically there's some ec sensorimotor point cortex, layer two, layer three, ca one, CA three DG is for DTA jars. but if you look at, very simplified neuron, enteral cor, cellinoid cortex from layer three, there is a soma that, projects it axon. There's very simplified arrow. and the ca one kind of captures it. So there's like a, this column mon mono synaptic pathway. 'cause there's just only one synapse. Associated with it. there's some other pathways where like the layer two, an cortex would project to the denate gys and the denate, the green dentate gys, would project to ca three and ca three would project to ca one. we don't need to go into this, but basically there's a couple of monos synaptic or, tri synaptic circuitry where, ca one can be influenced, from ec. And I think this is already I think this is established, but now we're finding others more, connections to this. but the idea was like, okay, what they knew at that time at least, was okay. So if we want to know what, where place cells are generated and let's look one, one synapse upstream, at the tineal cortex and, do the same experiment. We're gonna six electrodes, and see what we find. And just to comment, yeah. 'cause I'm not seeing this kind of view before, but it's kinda interesting that, the way that kind of apical dendrites are arranged in the hippocampal complex, it's almost like it's an inside out, cortical layer. as in, because it's, L one is at the bottom, and then you have almost the, pyramidal projection from L six is, superficial. But yeah, I don't know. It's just kinda interesting in terms of thinking about the kind of potential evolution. I think at this point. I think it's just all things are flipped on top of each other, yeah, up and down, doesn't make any sense anymore.

I think though, I'm not sure if it's hippocampus or, yeah, nevermind. I, but I think there's, so soma is like mostly in, what they call layer two or three. Yeah. So like superficial. Yeah. So no matter how you orient it, it's kinda it's closest to the, edge of the structure.

You wanna, Jeff, same thing. No, I just, at this point, it's all topsy-turvy, so what's up and what's down doesn't make much difference. you know what this is all coming across the, neocortical sheet is, it comes around the side of the brain and wraps up on, into the middle, and it stops becoming classic neocortex and it starts becoming wonky. So it, it's the same sheet, but, so the first thing is theron cortex, which is, okay, it's no longer six layers. they made up some number of layers, and then you can see it wraps into ca one, then it wraps around underneath. and, so what's top, what's bottom is meaningless at this point. I think, and one of the theories that was proposed a long time ago, which I but I'm not sure if it's true or not, and I'm, I've mentioned this many times, is that this circuitry where you have these three layer cir, three layer tissues wrapping on top of one another, could have evolved into the six layer cortex. So you can imagine this is how it started and, and the basic properties that we assume in the cortical column are all here, plus some other stuff. And then, and evolution, just guy, Hey, instead of this wrapping us around on each other, this, make it a thing and extend it out. And then it becomes a six layer cortex. but I find the circuitry, diagrams of the hippocampal complex are very, confusing and, hard to interpret. And different researchers say different things. And so I, yeah, I've generally come to say, yeah, I don't worry about it too much. it's basic connectivity is important, but what's up and down? What layers are labeled one, two, and three are kind of meanings at this point. Yeah. Yeah. so continuing on as a. Doing the same experiment where the electro suck in, we can, trace where the mouse has been with the, gray lines and the black with that one particular grid cell, where it fired. And, the surprising, finding was that, okay, this seems to be, firing out like a, this triangular or al lot like, pattern and grid cells. so I'm gonna go over like a few properties or I guess characteristics of, not really properties, but characteristics of grid cells that are like commonly used in, commonly used terms.

in papers. So like when we talk about, sometimes we say oh, the, phase is possible. I, wanna make sure ev I wanna make sure everyone understands this because this can be, the basics can be very, confusing when we see this pattern like this. This is a single cell firing in multiple locations in an environment, whereas opposed to place cells was a cell that applied in one location, in an environment.

this, I want that basic idea is that this is one cell we're looking at here. and of course every location and environment, there'll be different grid cells or different place cells flying. So there's always some activity, but, and so here, uniquely grid cells seem to not be very specific. They do not represent a specific location. They represent, multiple locations. And so they're not a very good indicator of location. Yes. In this specific figure, we, the red and the green and the blue, they're different cells, right? Or so it's yes, there's two cells. Okay. Yeah. Alright. So there's two good cells. Are you gonna explain this? Oh yeah. you're welcome to take over too.

Sorry, it's hard for me to, Oh, no, I mean me keep quiet. No, I literally think that you can do shopping screening, so that's why I'm not commenting on your frequent comments. I like it. yeah, so the, in this case, these are two green grid cell and a blue grid cell. And in the face, the same kind of periodic, like the, same pattern exists except one is just shifted from one another. So this is not an absolute measure, it's just one is, it's a relative measure to, like another grid cell. scale obviously is when the spacing between the, cent, the oid or center of the firing fields or, extended. spacing of the grid cells and orientation. this is shown relative, so the, blue grids. So if we say that the green one is aligned vertically, then we can say that the blue is rotated slightly, 10, 15 degrees. usually it's orientation sometimes, and this one is, more relative, but oftentimes it's actually oriented like the measurements are with respect to an orientation, like of a wall. so oftentimes these are done in boxy environments. So now that is kind changing, for reasons I'll talk about in the future. lemme lemme just, I, think there's some more detail here that's worth point. Yes, go ahead. on the left picture, we're showing two cells at different phases. These cells would be right next to each other, and a set of would, cover the entire environment. And that is a grid cell module? Yeah. A grid cell module is a set of grid cells that all have the same fa, the same scale and orientation, but have different phases. If in the middle one we have different scale, these are two different grid cell modules. So grid cell module A may have one scale grid cell. Module B may have another scale, and they are typically, arranged in a linear forming going to larger and larger scales. And then finally two grid cell modules when they anchor on an environment, when a grid cell module anchors on an environment, like when it says, oh, I'm representing this room, it has an orientation relative to the room. And so two grid cell modules can have two different orientations relative to the room. And a grid, any grid cell module could, orient itself to, vertically in one room and diagonally in another room. So we're looking at, in the left, we're looking at properties of cells within one grid cell module, and then on the right we're looking at the properties of cells in two different grid cell modules.

Yes. Yeah. Cool. or cells in a grid cell module, generally next to each other in the brain, right? They are. And there's a famous picture we've looked at several times here, from a tank. I call it the tank paper. He shows exactly how these cells are, aligned, and he proved that the, they are literally in a grid cell module. They're literally the adjacent cells are adjacent, just like in this figure.

yeah. And then so the, these are the three, or I guess the fourth one that I would add in that, that is common in the cell literature, something called redness score or gs. So you'll probably see that in some of the figures that I screen captures. That's what it means, but basically how, gritty, the cells are. how they calculate this is, once they get the firing field, they mask out, the portion. this one is easier to see. so that, they take the hx, the hexagon mascot, everything else, and mascot, the middle portion, rotated, by, 30, 60, 90, a certain degrees and, calculate the, correlation between the rotate version and the oral version. So if it's very like regular grid-like pattern, you're gonna have a high correlation score. if it's, not well correlated, it'll be very low. And the difference between the two is, is a grid score. So in this case, like in the very like grid-like cell, this, score will be very high because, after 60 degree rotation, it'll have a very high number. while in 30 it'll have the very negative correlation. So the difference is much bigger. While in this one, the NESS score is much, much smaller. and I'm getting this because I realize, I, I guess that when I was reading, like one of the original papers, I was like, how did they know that this, is like red cells, this is like purely a functional characteristics. And, I, generally come from a more like morphological or like a trench atomic way of defining cells. I was like, so how do they know to poke the electrode here? And I realize that it's more ad hoc. It's they measure these firing, rates, after sticking the electrode. And if the grid score was, above the efficient threshold, then it was characterized as grid cells. so in the, I think the way they threshold for grid cells is a little bit different by paper, but I, at least the original one, they consider any cell that was, that had a score of 0.2, grid score 0.2 or higher to be grid cells. and Right, rejected the other ones. But it's even more complicated than that. and, or at least more interesting than that. So when they first started. Looking for, as you pointed out, Hojae, they're trying to find out what was the predecessor or the lead into a place cell. And so they looked in the hin cortex, by the way, the, the O'Keeffe lab looked there first, but they didn't find grid cells because they were looking at grid cell modules that were too big in scale. And so they couldn't find cells that responded to the small environment where the Moses came along and by chance picked another part in the onic cortex where the grid cell modules were smaller scale and they found grid cells.

now the, you're right. What they were, look, once they found this grittiness, they looked for cells that were really gritty, right? That, that had this behavior. So they found, oh, we found these grid cells. But there are huge numbers of cells in the anti cortex that are not classic grid cells.

they might, be directly sensitive, so the cells respond when the, when animal was moving on direction, but there's still some grittiness to them. So you could have a cell that was directly sensitive, but also spied in a periodic location along some dimension. And so that's not a classic grid cell, because grid cells, classic grid cells are just, they're independent of movement and direction. They're just like this, you're at this location. So now they found all these different types of cells in the ancor, dozens of different ones that are not classic grid cells. But you can then assign a grid score to each one saying, oh, this one has some grittiness to it. This one more grittiness to it. And of course, the classic grid cells are the, if they find those, and those are all very nice grid. Yeah. So it's a way of not just saying which is a grid cell or not, but it's also a way of saying, Hey, there's all these other cells that have shared some properties of grid cells. Yeah. And so also to go back to like quietly this earlier question, are they next to each other in the sense that, are they like two cells connected? I don't know if it's that close just by eye. But they're closing up that they're, they, are in, you mean this picture? We can, no, we can look at the, tank paper later. This picture. no, it's only in the tank paper, where they prove this in that. Oh, okay. Okay. For the, within a grid cell module, the cells are just, they are laid out like a map, in terms of, they're not, they're, immediately adjacent to each other. Okay. I can show you that picture later if you don't see it. Okay.

yeah. all these, by the way, all these other cells, there's, remember like a lot of things, scientists will find, oh, we found these grid cells, but they may be only 10 of the cells and 90 of the cells are not grid cells. And, they don't know what they are, so they don't report on 'em, but they then they say, oh, they're grit. So they have grittiness to them.

yeah. yeah, that's another question. It's I, what percent of cells and internal cortex is grid cells? I'm not exactly sure. I don't, know either, honestly. But it's, when Huble and Diesel did their first experiments on cats, they reported all these cells of this edge detectors and so on, that was less than half the cells, more than half the cells. They had no idea what they were doing. And, they just, they say, these cells seems to be wonky, these spikes every once in a while, we don't know why. Or these cells are, seem to be silent. So the same thing happens here. They find cells that are looking for cells that are gritty. and then they say, oh, here's one has some grid properties to it. Yeah.

it is just a interesting concept, at least coming from me, Like I, I would think that you would find something that might be grid cells first and then, measure the properties, but backwards in some sense. for me, anyway, so, how these, some of these properties can vary. Jeff mentioned scale varies by, Scale is actual. Yeah. Organized anatomically like, so as you go from, dorsal to ventral in fin cortex, whatever that means of dorsal ventral in this sheet doesn't really make sense, but it a, it's relative. It's relative to the head, right? So It's like a dorsal fin on a shark. It's like towards the top of the, back, top of the head. And yeah, I think for mouse it's actually the, it's consistent, but for humans it's like the dorsal, but I think I remember like the definition flips as you go from brain to spinal cord. 'cause the, maybe, it's crazy. Yeah. Anyway. Yeah. It's a little bit crazy. So, I'll just have to take this figure for it. It doesn't matter. It don't, it's only important if you're a Yeah. Cutting into the animal and trying to find this stuff if you don't need to. Yeah.

and so basically you knows a, so like within kind of the anatomical region, that grids will have small scale and it'll go increase, and it'll increase, as you go to ventral. the, so I think pe most people agree that, this kind of scaling, is like a geometer progression with about, I think that Moses reported, 0.42 because it was like a square of two. which means that area, increases by a factor of two for every module. some other report, like anywhere between 1.3 to 1.7. But basically when we say cell module, this is not a continuous change. These are, this is not a, this change. Like you, you go from one good or module at one scale, then it jumps to the lawyer and then it jumps to the next one. Yeah.

and actually I think this bullet point is incorrect, but, so I think the original. There's many consensus or opinions on how many modules, of these actually exist in the animal. I think one that I heard first said of four to five, but now, other papers have said like up to 10 maybe. but, I think right now the general consensus is always somewhere between three to 10 I would say. This is, I, this is an important, this is a very important number. yes. We just, I dunno you gonna, why that's important. I don't, I are you, oh, go ahead. I'm not gonna, I was gonna move on to the next project. I, don't know if you know all this stuff Hojae, so it's, as I said, it takes months to get Earl. yeah. if we want one of the way to get unique representation initially, some, another people proposed and we, concluded it in our, frameworks paper, is that if you, if each of these grid cell modules anchors independently, then, then the combination of which cells are active in each grid cell module, becomes unique. And this is where the idea of unique locations comes from. But to really mathematically to get a unique location like we would like, from a theory point of view, you need more than three to five modules. You want at least 20. Yes. and, it's, and also you wouldn't really want 'em at very different scales. That wouldn't work too well either, because if you're in a small environment, the big scale doesn't really tell you anything. So this is always a problem that remains if we're gonna form unique representations of space, you need to have lots, you need more than three to five or even 10 modules like this. And so I'm gonna propose later how I think this might be occurring. But, we were so excited about this. It's a really cool idea that you can combine a bunch of grid cell modules and you get this unique location, even though each grid cell module is, not unique. And, but the numbers never really worked out very well for us. yeah. but I have a potential solution to that. Maybe it's worth actually go commenting on, oh, no, go ahead. OJ Oh, Go ahead, go ahead. I was just gonna say, it's worth commenting that orientation can also contribute to that, the orientation differences, the coding differences. Like basically you, you want looking at the, maybe if you go back this slide, sorry, Hojae. I, I, yeah. This one, like basically you can imagine that with shifts in phase and orientation and or scale, you can basically get interferences where you have different grid cells are all firing, at one particular location, but they don't co-align, they don't interfere at other locations. And that's what kind of gives you the unique readout of a location. Despite that a single grid cell or even an entire grid cell module is, cannot uniquely define a location. So one, one of the things we talked about, and I think we've talked about is this group, but prior to this group as well, is that you could have multiple grid cell modules at the same scale as long as they have different orientations and different anchoring as, Neil's point out. And, but then you'd have to have a bunch and it, there, I couldn't find any evidence that there was a bunch of grid cell modules stacked on top of one another in this at the same scale. and that was a problem too. yeah. I have a question. yes, we are saying the word unique, but what is unique? Like millions, billions, trillions that we have in the universe, right? So, let's do the math here on this. Let's say, A grid cell module, a cell represents, one 10th of, the area of an environment. So maybe you could say, for the single grid cell module, I would know, I would know where I can only know where I am one 10th of a time. it's it's not unique, right? 'cause the cells fire over and over again, different places. but a single mo, a single cell might represent one 10th of the area. If I had two grid cell modules that were not exactly the same, then it'd be 10 times 10. I could re represent a unique combination of the twos would be a hundred. So it's basically, you tend to the nth power, if I had 20 grid cell modules, it'd be 10 to the 20th. That's how many unique locations I could represent, which is a very big number. So that's sufficient for us. But 10 to the three or 10 to the five, probably not, And so you would wanna have a whole bunch of these things so that the combination would be unique in that, you wouldn't have false positives and false negatives and things like that. Does that help you answer that question?

You look confused. I was just running some numbers. So so 10 to the, so but is 10 to the seventh enough or that 10 to the 20 business? I don't know what's enough. I don't know. Maybe that's what, I was asking. Like 2021 because there's math we can do where you can have five grid modules that will give you 21 million unique codes. how do you do that? How'd you get to that? the phases have to be, they have the phases can, if they're co prime phases like 3, 4, 5, 7, 11, you can, they, will align perfectly. Remember, in grid and cells and neurons, there isn't any kind of thing like the coding we have in computers. I if I have a bunch of neurons and nine of 'em are the same and one's different, that's not unique. These are sparse distributed representations, and so you can't say, it's not oh yeah, one total different will gimme a very, large number. that's what we rely on computers, right? One bit. Every bit makes a big difference. So you can just say it's two to the end bits, and that's how many representations you have here. Now that's not the way it works here. You have to, these, the cell combinations have to be fairly unique. and this is what you get with sparse distributor representations. I, we could spend a lot more time on this, but, I, I think the, the dimension of uniqueness I was talking about is the phase. As long as the phases are co prime with each other, five different modules with five different phases that don't overlap. Like they, that are co prime, that is it's a rare for them. A grid cell module doesn't have a phase. It's the cells within the grid cell module has a phase, right?

yeah, the cells within the grid, cell modules, if those are co prime and they get five of those, then you can get 21 million separate. No, basically, I think that's Jeff's point. Like all the cells in the grid cell module have the same phase. So, there's no amount of kind of interference between those. they'll always fire at different times and, consistently, I think, oh, okay. I, might say something a little bit different on the slide, which is that the cells, like within the module, the grid map, I can just read what's what I said here within modules, the grid map is Virginia universal IU scale, orientation, and phase relationship preserve across environments. as in, I think that is that right? I, didn't think, the cells within a module have the same scale, orientation and phase, but in a different environment. They have different orientations. the whole good cell module can be rotated differently in another environment. Yes. So within a module, there's a rigid relationship between the cells. Yes. But the, there are cells of different faces. So as in, this orange is slightly, translated from the blue, by a little bit this messy picture. So within a module, yeah. So this is still within a module, the orientation. I think the orient in this case, the orientations are, I think the same. it's a little bit hard to tell, but at least the faces are different. I think these are all the same module. These cells aren't these cells. Yeah. Within, yeah. In the, same module, like three cells are nearby each other. All cells within a module have the same orientation Yeah. And the same scale. Yes. always. There's no change in that. Yeah. But the phases, the, phases just represent this cell response to this area, and the next one respond to different area, and, the frequency which is basically the scale is gonna be the same problem. But yeah, maybe it's worth just pointing, going back to your, comment, Tristan, that these are grid cells in the enteral cortex. We don't know if the exact same, properties exist in kind of whatever is giving us location path integration in, cortical columns. like maybe that is more of a code based on, as you're saying, like different phases that then interfere. But I don't think so. I think it's extremely unlikely. So just, I'll state that it's possible, but I don't think so. yeah. Jeff is gonna go into more detail about, yeah. so I, I think what Tristan was saying with, I think was it, remind me of this visualization where, you have grid cells of the same, this is from one module where it's the same spacing, but different phases. But it, it's only this location where all five Wire together, while in other locations only two of them or three of them, might do and that might be how, it might be good giving location. these are different grid cell modules, right? This is not, these are not cells in the same grid cell module. These are different grid cell module. These are no same module because they have the same spacing and orientation, but different phases. but if they, because they, don't have this so orientation, and they don't have the same, no, otherwise you wouldn't get this pattern. I told you this is a very confusing field. okay.

this is, you see what they're showing here is that there's a bunch of grid cell modules are firing at the same location. Those measure Those grid cells are gonna be in different modules. And there's a module, the, different color cells are in different modules and they have different gale and they have different orientations. And what this is showing is that even though each module is not very unique, each module cannot tell you very in much detail where you are. If you look at the combination of the modules at any point in time, only, only a set of one cell in each module will be active in C four. That combination is pretty unique. So those, this, these have to be in different modules is, my understanding.

And, so this is what I was trying to say is you only need five modules to generate 21 million unique spots where they all align. I don't see that. I don't know how you get that number, Tristan. That doesn't, I don't think that's right. So I'm not sure what math you're doing to get to that. it just, yeah. but that's what I was trying, that's what I was asking like. Because if we are saying that there's 10, then mathematically it is possible for 10 modules to refer to. I don't, I think, you and I are thinking about it differently because I don't think 10 is sufficient, but 10 doesn't get you that kind of numbers.

I think these are, this is showing something different. This is showing like Yeah, kinda what Jess describing, like the core, idea behind how different grid cell models do it. Because these, yeah, these have the same spacing, it's the same scale. They actually, it's debatable. You can't really say they, whether they have different phases because clearly at one point they're all aligned. So in that sense they're in the same phase, but they have different orientations and so that's what's giving them this like only one point of interference. if they had, yeah, different spacings then, then within a module, which if that was a thing or let's say within a cortical column or whatever, then yeah, that could maybe do something like that. But, but it's not really the phase, it's the, it's more the spacing that needs to differ. The spacing or the orientation. Or the orientation. Those are the two things that give you, because the phase is what tiles space. and so like they're gonna have to have different phases because otherwise you're gonna have gaps where no neuron fires.

The, here's another way to look at this. I'm not addressing your question directly, Tristan. We can try to figure that out later. what grid cells give you, the important thing they give you is they don't give you a unique location, but they give you the ability to do path integration. So that's a property that's we mentioned before of animals in the dark and it moves the grid cells fire correctly in sequence. And so there has to be for that to work mechanistically. There has to be some sort of structure to them that's repetitive. And I don't know how to describe it other than just to say that. so you get this ability to, give a movement vector. The animal says, I'm moving in some direction, and the grid cells change which grid cells in a module change act, adjacent one becomes active and another one becomes active and another one, and then they repeat over and over again. but it gives you that ability to do path integration and therefore the, this regular tiling of the space is actually essential for that. The mechanism wouldn't work if there were, didn't, if a grid within a grid cell module, all the cells have to have the same, the same, spacing and the same orientation, and they have to be just separated in phase, really phase meaning just, one fires here, the next one fires here, the next one fires here as you move through space, and then they repeat again.

the property of this grid of being a triangular lattice is essential for the mechanism to work. And we can't get away with that. We can't get away from that.

we can math, we can encode, do whatever we want, but no, can't do that. I don't know if that helps, but it just, I'm just trying to make the point that within a grid cell module, all the cells have the same spacing and they're range arranged and they all have the same orientation and they just, they're just, you take the lattice that one cell responds to and you ship it over, that's the next cell and ship it over, that's the next cell and ship it over. That's the next cell.

Probably need a paper for it to actually find that. I mean if, we, will solve this kind of uniqueness problem if, we only allow the scale to be different across modules, but allow for phase of orientation to be different within a module. then, like things like this can happen. It's, so the uniqueness requires multiple grid cell modules? Yes. and never grid cell modules where the grid cell modules differ in either scale or orientation.

and that. And they, on any particular environment that they remap, the orientation and the, which cell is active in which environment? it, they have to remap. So it's like the same good cell modules, but they remapped randomly, I'd say. yeah. I don't know how to describe it better. It's so damn hard. So, my, my, my original question was, so what is you, do you have an intuition for, it's unique enough, you said tell 10 to the 20 is unique enough, but like 10 to the 10 maybe isn't is it somewhere in there? It's, I don't know, for our needs. It's a great, it's just a great question. what we want in, when we want in our learning modules in, in Monty, which is equivalent of, cortical column. So in a cortical column, what you'd want is that there's a representation of location in layer six. and that has to be unique enough so that, it's, I'm not gonna confuse that location for a, location in other objects or locations on the same object that, you know. So what is that? It depends on how many objects I learned and it depends on what's my tolerance for, making mistakes or false positives. so I don't have an answer to that. other than it's, you want to be pretty unique. You don't wanna have mistakes. I think, yeah, there is, I actually posted about this on discourse today 'cause someone was asking about, in the paper that Marcus Lewis was first author of in 2019, there's a fairly extensive analysis of, how you vary as you vary the parameters, like the number of grid cell modules, how many cells are in each grid cell module, things like that. You get a change in the capacity to learn different objects before they start interfering with one another and causing the system to fail. so yeah, if you're interested, Tristan, I can, I can link you to that. And it goes into more detail. Here's, another thing that interesting. When, an animal first appears in an environment and it doesn't know the environment, or it doesn't recognize it, maybe it's, it just hasn't gotten enough information to know where it is.

and the grid cells anchor in one, one way. and it's a, I think it's more of a sort of a generic way. It's I, have to check on this. I'm not a hundred percent certain about this, but, it, there's a couple things happen once the grid cell modules seem to expand their, their, scale a little bit, I'm not really sure. And then they also anchor in a way that's not unique. So it's more like a generic room. Okay, this is a generic rectangle, but then if I recognize, oh no, this is the particular rectangular room that has the food in this corner, and the little toy in that corner and the window over here, then they re-anchor to form a unique representation. So it's this sort of, non-unique default anchoring, that is like generic space and then, becomes, oh, I know what it is. It's this particular one. Something like that. is that non-unique, re-anchoring with respect to the body? Is it like egocentric? No, it's, it's, always, allocentric. It's always respect to the environment. It has to be with respect to some objects. no. It could be, it just could be random. It could be the default.

I guess you, I see what your point, Ramy, I don't know. I guess I see your point. I, don't know. I, think, I don't know if there's any experiments where you put the rat in a featureless void. Yeah. I'm not sure we found a paper that explores this, but it would be interesting like, yeah, that. Think it's in, general the animal knows, I think what environment it is in, it's right away. it's hard to, it knows it's, it knows it's in a rectangle. It may not know which rectangle the box it's in, right? But nor normally, I think this is deliberate. Normally they don't obscure information in the room, like right there will be like unique things on the ceiling and stuff like that. And that's just considered part of it that the animal knows it's in that room. But I think there have been experiments where they do it 'cause it, I do remember these experiments where the, the animal, when the animal doesn't know what room it's in, it forms one representation. But when it knows what rutin, then it, it anchors and then it knows. So this what here, one of a very interesting thing about this, these experiments, typically are the rat in a maze or a box. And the top of the box is open.

And, and if you looked up, you'd see the, they see the room of the experimenters, you'd see the labs. Sometimes you even see the experimenters themselves hovering over the, rat would see them, but they ignore that and they say, oh, this is a feature of this box. And and so the rat's in there, we didn't put any features on the walls yet, so he doesn't know what room, he has no way of knowing. He has no input, which is bullshit. 'cause they, the, animals can see the room above. but there have been some experiments where they completely seal it off. And then you see this property where they're at I believe, I'd have to go check again. It's been a long time, that the, it forms a sort of generic representation of space based on this is a box or a rectangle or circular environment. And, then when it becomes a particular circular environment or a particular rectangle environment, it re anchors.

that would be great if there were some studies. I'm curious, Hojae, just to preview what's to come next. Did, you come across anything like that when in the limited time you had to look? You mean like the wall being covered or not experimental setup where like the animal would be unsure what room it is and then they're measuring grid cells and then it suddenly recognizes that it's a different, there are lot, I feel like often they're focused on play cells and play cell reor. I dunno if they specifically look at what the grid cells are doing. I'm pretty sure IIII bet you if we asked Marcus or they would remember. Yeah. okay, so the whole idea of, sorry. The whole idea of re-anchoring is, I remember they would take a room and they would hide. they would, the room would be identical until they put like a white placard on one wall and then the animal would re-anchor to that white pocket, or they put a red pocket on the other wall. The, an animal would re-anchor differently. So there, there is this sort of anchoring based on visual clues that tell the animal which Yeah, which is which definitely. Yeah. Yeah. So if they color one side of the room differently from the other, it's, that, that can cause, re angry. Yeah. the other gosh, thing related to like unfamiliar environments is that oftentimes they say okay, we waited four days until the animal got familiar with the environment and then measured, the grid cell, whatever activity. And, okay. So this is a slide that I, didn't add in another, and also like a secret property that I didn't add in here is field size. So basically the size of the circle is another kind of property that is sometimes special but not often explored enough. and that is basically, like what's the radius diameter of the firing field? and what they found is that, in unfamiliar environments, the fuel sites would temporarily increase. So if oh, pick a mouse and go somewhere, the fuel site will temporarily increase and then over time it will decrease, which also escape to me, okay, if the fuel site's decreasing, that means that there's poten, I don't know. That means that if there's like as many, if there's enough number of grid cells and basically the re resolution of a location is getting higher, I think, and, also by, by that, the number of lo unique locations that we can identify gets higher. So the more, no, I'm not sure if that's true, but that's not true because think about the number of grid cells hasn't changed. So imagine these grid cells perfectly tile the space. So every place in the environment, at least one of the grid cells is firing. If you make the grid cells feel larger or small, if you made it smaller, then there's spaces in the environment wouldn't respond at all. So it's, with making 'em larger, you're just introducing uncertainty. You're just saying, oh, I'm not sure from here or here or here but it doesn't increase the resolution of the environment That's dictated by the number of grid cells there are.

Yeah. If you don't, if you don't increase the number of good cells, then you can't encode more space. More, more. You can't have more locations in Yeah. Maybe not resolution, but certainty. You, might think you're in multiple locations, like kind of multiple hypotheses to use Monte terminology while the field sizes are large. But then as they narrow Those hypotheses collapse into a smaller number or one. Here's another thing that I think they showed, you remember I mentioned earlier, the animals in the dark, the grid cells do the path integration. But, and you and I've talked about this too, you can experience this yourself if you're really in the dark and you start moving. You get more and more uncertain as to where you are, as you move. And then if you then find a clue, like if I'm in the dark and I touch a corner of a wall in my room, oh, I know where I am, then you're exactly anchored again Exactly in space, right? So I speculate, I don't know, but I speculate what's going on as you path integrate and you don't have any visual or any other clues to tell you where you are. Those, farming fields will get larger. It's just yeah, you're passing, but you don't really know where you are anymore, some blobby area. and then you get a clue and then they narrow down again. That's how I've always suspected that happened. I don't have any evidence, but, that's what it feels like.

Okay. My phone just beep, but it's been one hour, oh God. And I'm only one, one third of the way through. okay. So let me see if I can pick up again. Okay. So went over this slide. Oh, grid cells know the animals. Okay. This is a simple one, and also I wanted to put one of the, most important ideas of where TP came from. so one grid cells found in, mouse red macco that's human, human only by FMI. 'cause you can't just poke a electrode interior because this not recommended, back might seem random, but that's actually because they wanted to see, how there's a grid cell activity in, animals that navigate naturally in 3D space by flying.

and yeah, so the, main idea that we had in, mean, probably Josh statement honestly. is that, so we're combine combining kind of two experimental, two types of that is one by FMRI. We have some evidence that there's grid cells in the human trinal, chlorite, and then there was another paper, was that there seems to be grid like activity in. Cortex of mice. So combining these together, it's not really a stretch to say that there's poly brick cell-like activity in spinal sensory or, other corcal areas of human. I, I think that's, all true, but that's not how it came about Hojae. What it came about is we logically deduced that cortical columns must have a representation of location, of the sensorimotor input. We logically deduced that there has to be path integration. You just move your finger and you anticipate what you're gonna feel. Yeah. we knew this had to happen at a local basis that had to happen of every patch of your skin. It's not clear that it has to happen locally on the visual cortex, but we said, yes, it does. And then we said, how could a colorectal column represent a location with path integration like that? and, Peoria had no idea how neurons could do this. It's just like, how could they possibly do this? I have no idea. But then we realized that grid cells did something similar. And so we studied grid cells and we realized, oh, grid cells are this really complicated mechanism that does exactly what we want. So then we said, took a guess, saying it's unlikely that Cortex evolution came up with a different mechanism to do the same thing it was already doing in the enteral cortex. Much more likely it took the same mechanism and repurposed it in the cortex. So it was pure speculation. We didn't know about the evidence of, grid cells in, in, neocortex. We did not know that. We had no evidence for that at the time. And we said, you know what? We're gonna guess that there's gonna be grid, select mechanisms in the neocortex, in the lower layers, throughout the cortex. And then afterwards, we learned that there was evidence for this. And, but it seemed, a, fairly safe bet. To say this is so damn complicated. It's immediately, it's in the same cortical sheet. It's just further over, in the same sheet of tissue. It's almost certainly that whatever evolution discovered for the enteral cortex is gonna be used in cortex as well. And then, we found evidence of that.

I see. It's not everything you said is true, it's just the order of which it happened. Yeah. okay. and then I went over, this, oh by the way, this, these two pictures are from, the ment HTM school. I think. somebody created like a Jupyter notebook of like how you, can move your mouse over, and then this like tiny little mouse would actually move over your screen and it will be colored by this kind of circular, red cell firing fields. I couldn't find the actual GitHub repro. maybe somebody else might, but I'll, I did find a YouTube video of it. Anyway, all these, the, and I'm, glad that I put asterisk, actually, the story may not be this simple in terms of how grid cells get rise to like place fields or unique locations. It, the idea generally that was gonna proposed by the Moses was that, if you have results and of, different modules and you stack them together, depending on how they overlap or interfere, that would give unique fields. But I feel like it's a little bit more complicated than that. and then there's also the question of I didn't know it was the Moses, you did that. I thought something else did there, but I'll take your word for it. Na, they may have done Yeah, I thought there was, yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

I think honestly people's like opinions are changing I feel like, even through the 10, past 10 years. So it's a little bit hard to say. and there's also a question, research, some of the research in this field are very competitive with one another, so they, okay. So maybe I shouldn't say no, I'm not gonna say names. Names, but I do know there's a lot of, counterclaims and claims. Yeah. It's very interesting, this field of very dynamic, actually. I thought this was stalled in some sense, like this textbook knowledge. And I realized this is very not textbook knowledge. we're, debating a lot of things.

and, Jeff, this is my only mention of the word acid inter interference, which is, one of a couple of models that may that tries to explain where grids, how grid cells are, firing fields are generated. 'cause the, natural question of okay, if we if we take this hypothesis that, gr what combinations of grid fields can give rise to police fields, then the question is where are these grid fields, coming from? and there's a couple theories and sadly that's all that mention about it. I just did Yeah, go ahead. anyway, so we will, I will get through quickly so we can actually get to that part. Or you can explain more about, on its own one could just, one can just ask how do grid cells get this property? What makes them fire like this? And there are two basic theories. one's called O interference and one's called continuous detractor networks. And, I believe the right answer, was exposed in a paper, that said it's a combination of the two. So we can, I'll talk about that later. Okay. And I think there's four like new meta videos on hybrid models of grid cells, oi interference and continuously track network. So if anybody's interested, there's four, at least four videos of that from five years ago. Something like that. But there'll be an update here as well. Okay. Yeah. Wonder if, I dunno if, this would be a good time to, swap over just for a bit, at least to Jeff, what you were gonna present. And then we can see how much time there is for the rest of, this Hojae at the end and then Oh yeah. That, that works to you say, since you were gonna talk essentially about how grid cells emerged. Yeah. Yeah, I think that's a good idea. we could spend weeks going down the rat hole of grid cells, Yeah. It's unbelievable. but I think I could bop up a level to make it more applicable to Monty here. yeah, sounds good. maybe can I, if you don't mind, maybe can I do just like one recent org that, sure. That may be interesting.

this probably I just, so I think this 2022 paper, was pretty interesting in the sense that, so what they did, was that instead of taking this petro, they, took the new neurop pixel, electrodes, suck it into the mouse, and, me measured the activity of grid cell grid cells within a module, a across time. And then they, yeah, so they have a population vector. So basically they measured about 500 to a thousand cells at the same time. So each time point has a vector of, the number of neurons that they have measured. So in this humongous 500 dimensional vector, they, the, dimensional inductions of PCA and, something called UAP to make this visualization. And they found that the, it seems like the activities of these, 500 to, a thousand neurons from the same modules seem to be forming a oid. And, what is, it isn't a OID just describing the fact that they repeat? I'm confused by that. I'm not that far. Yeah. But I, the, okay. I think the most important part was that one, when they look at the grid cell firing in, this regular room of box, you get the hexagonal pattern, and the, same kind of equivalent pattern in this toy, this indicated by the black dots. And when they move to, when the, mouse moved to, a wheelbarrow like environment in 2D, the, firing patterns have changed, obviously because the environment's changed. But the, in 3D it hasn't. I'm not saying that the, I think this is Oh, interesting. Okay. Yeah, that'd be, I look to read the paper if you post that one. yeah, of course. Yeah. Just a general, comment on this area is that good cells seem to represent two dimensional, locations, a location in two dimensional space. And, then the natural question was, can they represent three dimensional spaces? And the, they did a lot of work with bats flying in large, environments. huge, these big tunnels and stuff. And, they can record from these cells while the bat is flying and Yep, it's amazing. and what they said found that the good cells still, seem to be, they, fired in particular locations, but in the third dimension, they lost their grittiness. Yes. Yes. And they were random looking and, their size changed. And so a whole bunch of weird stuff. So the last time I looked at this field, it was completely uncertain as to whether, what's going on in 3D. Yeah. Is that, so this may relate to that. Is that what you, this might relate to that? this, I, was gonna relate to re-anchoring as in, there's this particular statement that I was very confused about, which is grid cells form a metric space, this statement. and I was like, at first I was like, okay, this makes sense. And then I realized, okay, but if we're doing all these re-anchoring, it's not really a global metric space, is it? the, just the fact that we are re-anchoring and there's many ways that we can re anchor means that, an individual that is the local, you're confusing two things here, within a grid cell module, once it's anchored it's metric, and yes, meaning, meaning that I can start anywhere and move in certain direction and I get the same results, or I can do this path integration, come back to where I was. it's got this regular structure to it. that's independent of re-anchoring, re it's always gonna be metric, but it's, but it just, it's just the property of the cells as opposed to where it is in the world.

so yeah, so I guess I'm still kinda sorting throughout my head, but Yeah, I think one of the most striking thing was that these patterns can be, speared, compressed whatever, in different geometries. Or there's this crazy, I, think, you probably saw the trap zone one, but I'm not sure if you saw the hairpin maze one. Yes, You still have some, like, grid periodic city. but it's very dependent on the environment geometry. and I thought this one, this, 3D. One was kinda interesting because, I think the authors were trying to say that there's some environment geometry in variance with this, that, that said, I, I don't know if this, they, only test on two different environments and these, none of these are still natural environments, I would say. So I why don't you just post that paper and, yeah, we can look at it and see what, see its relevance to the issue of 3D space and which is an important topic for, Monty. Yeah. we talked about Monty, if grid cells really are 2D and is evidence that we've come up with just, observational evidence that we learned two dimensional maps, even of three dimensional objects talk about faces and dice and things like that. but we also said for Monty, it doesn't really matter. Why don't we can use 3D or nd so it's a very interesting, question from what does neuroscience do? what can we do? Do we have to do what neuroscience does? hopefully not, but, but it would be nice to understand if I understood how nature really represents 3D environments or spaces that would be helpful for us. So figuring out what might we might wanna do with Monty if what we're doing is sufficient or, okay. Yeah, it, seems this is more like you say Hojae about, what do you do in terms of keeping the metrics space consistent rather than necessarily help with the 3D thing. But I see. But in that sense, I feel at least not too worried in that I think to do what we want to do, which is, recognize objects and make predictions. It just needs to be consistent in Yeah. Locally. and I think that kind of fits as well with we experienced this ourselves when we were doing the TBP Olympics at the retreat that If you were to close your eyes and try and feel, an absolutely enormous object and like path integrate over the whole thing, you'd eventually get lost and confused about what's, what you're sensing. path integration's pretty much always gonna be noisy over like certain distances. but it's more just that like within a certain region it's okay, yeah, this feature is above this feature, this other feature is to the right of that feature and things like that.

that's the kind of key thing. And so even if it's like re-anchoring because okay, this is a new object, it can, it still gives us that kind of what we want of, kinda basically integrating movement.

I know that, I had with, TP Monty or with, remember one month ago we were talking about three streams in tp in Monty, their behavioral stream, morphological stream, and the feature stream. maybe, so we're separating out the, features from the morphology, if these are recorded not in the space that we are observing. So like we observe things in 3D in Habitat and then, we put that in a location in 3D like this, if this kind of representation basically gives an additional dimension that might give us a little bit more representational power to encode something more generic, possibly like a morphological, like a gen generic class of morphological model. and somehow like the combination of the morphological model and the features give a specific instance of a particular mug or a particular, a TP mug versus a Greek think some of that this is, I knew that's Yeah. Too far that, but that's right. But we do that, we're using that during the Temple memory me mechanism. we're defining minicolumns, we're defining the morphology of an object. And then you can form unique representations of that, morphological object. Not by changing the location space, but by changing the encoding. The feature. Yeah. Location combination. These are all very complex topics and, they take a long time to absorb.
