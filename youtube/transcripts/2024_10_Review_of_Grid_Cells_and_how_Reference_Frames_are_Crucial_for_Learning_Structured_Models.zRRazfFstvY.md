because I know some of the people here, probably know a lot about grid cells. Hojae, maybe you probably know more than I do, but my knowledge is a bit old. I haven't really read any papers about it in the last few years, so maybe three years or so. So I'm not up to date on the latest, but we were into it pretty heavily for a while back in the days. And, And of course, it's not clear how much of this is, relevant or necessary to know for, Monty and the Thousand Brains Project, because we're not going to emulate or model grid cells, at least that's not the plan at the moment. So I put down some basic, things about grid cells, how we, what we know about them, we don't know about them and how we thought about them for, the thousand brains theory. And, I guess in some of it's going to be simple for those of you who know this already and some of it, it could be really hard if you've not really been exposed to this. I remember it took me A few months, of real deep confusion before I really got it. It was like, I kept getting confused over and over again, but you finally sunk in oh, that's how these things work.

if you're at all like me, it may not settle in on the first couple of exposures. But, with that, I thought I could just jump right into it, unless someone wants to say anything before I get going. Yeah, I just agree also that it took me a while to, for it to sink in. Yeah, it's odd. It's really odd. so I'll just get going. I'm going to share my screen and then, I'm going to show you, a PowerPoint presentation I have here.

and not a lot of PowerPoint into this, really the best to make this, can we get rid of this stupid thing? Make this interactive if we can. Hopefully you see that. Do you see the list of text? Yes. Okay. so this is just talking points I wrote down. I've, I have images to go along with these, which I'll show you in a second. let's just start at the top of this list. the idea basically is that the brain has to have some kind of reference frames for various things. it needs to know where things are in the world. And we deduced, that each cortical column also had to have some sort of reference frame. and this is, it's a pretty solid deduction, especially for somatosensory, for touch. Where, that's the most obvious place when you touch something. If you're going to have an expectation of what you're going to feel, then the brain has to know where that finger is, or the patch of skin is, or whatever, you're touching. And it has to know where it is relative to something in the world, like an object you're touching. And, and as you move your finger, it makes new predictions. Therefore, it has to keep track of where your finger is. You can't know. It has some neurons that tell it this. So that's a pretty solid, deduction. and then, we, it was hard to imagine initially how neurons could create reference frames. but then we said, Hey, these are things called the grid cells in the enthorhinal cortex, which is related to the neocortex. It's, it's, you can follow the end of the neocortex to the very end. And so it's getting wonky and it turns into grid, enthorhinal cortex and hippocampus and things like that. And so there's, And a lot was known about grid cells. We didn't know a lot about them in the beginning. so we said, hey, obviously the neuro, evolution has discovered a way of doing a kind of reference frame using these things called grid cells. and it turns out they're pretty complicated. So we guessed that, that the cortex uses grid cells too. And, and now we know that there are many places in the cortex that do have grid cells. and we also, we made an early mistake, the third bullet here, we, didn't really deeply understand this one either, but columns not only need to know location of a sensor, they need to know the orientation of the sensor patch. so it's like you can touch something with your finger, but you can rotate your finger on that point, and the input coming from the finger changes, and the cortex needs to know not only where the finger is, but its orientation to the thing it's touching. and these are similar to grid cells and head direction cells, which in the hippocampal complex.

okay, this basically, we think that cortical columns are doing something relatively similar to what's going on in this, in these other parts of the brain. And I'll point out here, the last point here is that grid cells have been studied, heavily studied. There's a huge amount of literature on them. a lot is known about them, but there are many things that are still mysterious. There's a lot of details about them which are argued about, no one really understands, or if they do, I haven't, read about them. Maybe they figured it all out in the last few years, I don't know, I doubt it, but, there's still quite a lot of confusion about exactly how these things come about, and how they work, and so on. and I'll talk about some of those, some of the things we don't know. So then I'm, now I'm going to just go into grid cell basics, And then later I'll come back and talk about some things we don't understand. if there's any questions, just shout out. Maybe one other thing at least I found useful or interesting to think about is I guess the, like the connection between evolution and how the enthorhinal and hippocampal complex like likely predates the neocortex and maybe was a blueprint for the neocortex. And you can imagine how a more primitive animal, just needs to know about, basically have a reference frame for environments. that's the most important thing to first have a reference frame for is, where you're in an environment and how you move around it. But then that kind of idea of having a reference frame as a way of structuring information is a powerful, more general thing. And then what was this complex, specialized organ, kind of part of the brain for mapping environments could then potentially be turned into a more compact, more general, structure, which is cortical columns and then repeated, yeah, I appreciate that it's like speculation, but it's just an interesting way to think about like how you go from just first doing environments to like using the same concept for representing all information. and it's, and there's some other things that really suggest it. So trying to imagine now that cortex is this, Sheet of cells, we say it's six layers, let's pretend it's six layers. when it gets, as I said, when it gets to the sort of the end of its sheet, it turns into, it becomes less structured, less uniform. And the first thing, one of the first things it becomes is, literally follow the sheet and it becomes the enthorhinal cortex, there's other things first, but, and one can argue that the enthorhinal cortex is, Let's say roughly three layers thick, and then it continues on and it folds over on top of itself, and the hippocampus is now on top of, it's folded, like a sheet of paper, and now you have three layers of the hippocampus on top of the three layers of the enthorhinal cortex. And this is a very rough approximation, but it's true. And so the idea there is, one of the ideas that we didn't come up with, but it seems like it's a reasonable idea, is that the three layers of the hippocampus on top of the three layers of the enthorhinal cortex, then some, at one point in past history, became the six layers of the cortex. And so there's some analogies between the place cells in the hippocampus being the upper layers of the cortical column and the enthorhinal cells and the enthorhinal cortex being the lower layers, and I've always got that in the back of my mind. So not only did evolution discover this thing, but physically there's a suggestion that, the cortex became the fusion of these two three layer structures that are aligned on top of one another. Are you going to mention, place cells as well? I will in a second. So why don't I just get into that and then we'll do it. So let's just start the upper left hand of this picture. The first, cell in this, collection of cells that was discovered was the place cell. And this and the discovery of the place cells led to a Nobel Prize by O'Keefe. and, this picture on the upper left shows a rat walking around in a square box. And the black lines show where the rat was walking, and the red dots are a particular cell in the hippocampus of the rat that fired, and it fires at the red dots of where it fired. And so this cell seems to fire at a preference when the animal is in some location in this field. and and it was, it's consistently And so this, that was the beginning of the, of place cells. Now this is just one cell, and, but it seemed to say, hey, no matter which way, no matter which way the rat was facing, it doesn't matter, if he's in this area in the bottom right of this, cage or whatever it is, a big box, the cell, fires and marks a place. and so that was a, key discovery, and a lot of research was done on that. And then later, another team discovered a similar cell in the enthorhinal cortex called grid cells. And in this case, this picture is a little bit fuzzy, I apologize for that, but the middle image there of the circular field. This is a big circular box of rats running around in, and again, we're recording from a single cell here. It's the same idea, those black lines saying whether the rat was moving, and the red spots show where this particular cell fired, and it's consistent. it doesn't matter which way the rat moves around the box, whenever it gets into these locations, the cell fires. it's like some kind of a location signal. And I think this is just a heat map of showing where the cells were most active in those spots. And so you can see right now that the, this particular cell fires in a lot of different locations. This is just one cell, showing where it fires as it moves around in these locations. And it's, it turned out that this is in a sort of a, triangular, Or hexagonal pattern, where this cell fires and, now, so that's pretty, cool. Now of course, this one cell doesn't tell you where the animal is. if you just looked at the, where the cell is firing, it could be in any one of these locations. So it's not a very good, way of locating the cell. Locating the animal, but that's what it is. Now, of course, there's lots of other grid cells. And, they vary in a couple of ways. First of all, there's a whole bunch of grid cells that are, that share the same property of this one. So go down to the bottom right here, and you see the square that's labeled phase.

they're showing the activity of two cells here. This is a hypothetical one that's green and one that's blue. And these cells share the same spacing in terms of their firing pattern, the same orientation in terms of their firing pattern, but they have different phases. they fire at different locations and overlapping locations. And if you have a set of, you can find a whole set of grid cells. that essentially tile the space all with the same orientation and scale. So whenever the animal is at some, any location in, this environment or any environment, there's at least, there's a few grid cells that are firing and in the same grid cell module. And as the animal moves, the, which cells fire change, but all the cells in the same module, as they call it, have the same, orientation and scale. now there are other grid cell In the entorhinal cortex, if you move horizontally in some direction, you'll find a next grid cell module has a different scale, and so they'll be exactly the same thing we just saw before, but, the cells will fire at different, different spacings. and there's I forget how many of there are, but there's somewhere between five and 10 of 'em or something like that, that can easily identify like this. And so you get larger and larger scales, for the good cell modules. In fact, one of the, here's a little interesting historical anecdote. the people who discovered the place cells. They didn't discover grid cells because, and O'Keefe wrote about this because they were looking at cells that had a much larger scale and therefore at the scale, the actual grid cells they were looking at, of course, they didn't know they were grid cells, but the cells they were recording from, were grid cells. the scale was so large that there was only one cell, the cell only fired one place in the environment, so a rat has grid cells that scale to cover very large areas, maybe 50 meters or something like that, and if you're looking at those, then you won't see that cell fire in multiple locations in a particular smaller environment like this circular arena. So that's, it's an interesting thing, and then, at any point in time, the, yeah, go ahead. They, so they, they basically have a map of where the larger scale grid cells are and where the smaller scale grid cells are, and that's how they can now say that where they recorded back then is. Yeah, I guess so. I think there's some, yes, they do know. There's a particular direction you move across the enthorhinal cortex where the modules get larger and larger. This has been mapped out. I'll show you a picture of that in a second. Anyway, by the way, this is a little jumping ahead here, so you've got these multiple grid cell modules that, that increase in scale by I think like a factor of 1. 4 each time, so it's a multiplicative factor, something like that, maybe 1. 7, I can't remember the number. Anyway, but it reminds me of this change in the scales in the, in the regions in the cortex, like from V1 to V2 and V4, you have a similar sort of bump up in scale. And I've always wondered if it's the same process going on there, that literally the entorhinal a set of grid cell, place cell pairings, and they go up and they bump up to the next size, and it's the next size, it's very much like V1 and V2 and so on.

okay, any other questions on that?

So is, the hypothesis that place cells are basically disambiguating the grid cell firings, or what's the interaction between them? No, the basic hypothesis here is, and by the way, this is very heavily oriented towards my hypothesis, there's been a lot of literature about this. But, the general idea is that place cells are more sensory driven. they're based on observations the animal makes. It sees something and says, oh, okay. I now know where I am based on this visual input or tactile input or input from their whiskers or whatever. And grid cells are driven more by movement. And these to me, there's an analogy here between the cortical column, which are driven primarily by movement. by, sensory input, and the lower layers, which are driven primarily by motor path integration. and that, it looks like that in, so that's a very good hypothesis. That's the one I've always adhered to. There's a lot of detailed research about the correlations between grid cells and, place cells, and I can't recall all of it. It's just tremendous. Yeah. I think, the invited speaker we had a couple of weeks ago, Hagai, he looked at. How they influence each other in a bidirectional way. So the simple way to think about it for us, I think, at least for me, is that these place cells are very similar to the layer four type of cells we have, and they're driven by sensory input, and they're paired with the location in the lower layers, which are more equivalent to grid cells.

And so there's a bidirectional connection between those, and those connections do exist in the, between the hippocampus So it's, a very reasonable hypothesis. I would say, there's also an orientation because, these cells are spaced in like a triangular grid or hexagonal grid, there's a change in orientation, so when you go between, grid cell modules, from one module to the other, not only do you have a change in scale, but you can also have a change in orientation, and I believe that the orientation only varies slightly, suggested in this middle image, but they do change. And, you'll see in a moment why that's, that could be important.

one thing to, to note is when an animal goes into an environment, if the animal recognizes the environment, then the grid cells, what they do is they call anchor. That is, once the animal knows what environment it's in, The grid cell that was active in one particular place before becomes active again. In fact, all the grid cell modules anchor as if they were in this place before. If the animal goes into a different environment that's not the same one, then the grid cells anchor differently, meaning Maybe, let's say there were, let's say there were 50 cells, 50 grid cells in a module that, could be, active and so one is primarily active and the other couple maybe not so active and all the rest are not active. Well, which one act is active at some point in time is it is a choice the system makes and that's the anchoring. In a different environment, a different cell would become active. at some point. In fact, you could have two circular environments like this, and if there's a picture on the wall, a rat will see these as different environments, and the grid cells will anchor differently, but consistently between the two environments.

recognizing where the animal is, once the animal recognizes it, it ends. These grid cells, Lock in and anchor in the place they were before, and in some sense, establishing the same reference frame that was established the previous time the animal was in this environment. and that is a big part of what it means to recognize where you are. Is that, one study goes, oh, I know where I am, bingo, all the grid cells, and now you have this reference frame and everything can be predicted. But before then, Your grid cells might have a different anchoring position and you don't know where you are or you think you're someplace else. Is this something where, the place cells are really important in this anchoring process? clearly, sensory input is very important in the anchoring process, right? So it's very much like that. It's like sensory input coming into layer 4 of a cortical column, that sort of suggests where you might be in the world, but it's not definitive, perhaps. and, but once you've had enough observations, then, then the, layer six cells would, anchor. And, oh, yeah, we know where we are. We're in, we're on the coffee cup. We're on the stapler. yes, it's, the idea is that your sensory inputs are required to anchor the grid cells. The grid cells are not directly sensory driven. I say they're motor driven because here's an important thing, we'll get to this more in a bit, but when the animal moves through the, environment, of course, the grid cells, active grid cells change. and that can be, you could say, that the animal's seeing new things, but even if you turn off the lights and the animal's in the dark, So there's, no input that tells the animal where he is in this room. As the animal moves in the dark, the grid cells update. And so this is the idea of path integration. The animal says, I'm moving forward a certain amount in this direction. the grid cells update their internal representation, even though there's no sensory input. And, you can imagine, it's a noisy process. And after the animal moves a bit, yeah, the grid cells are updating, but, you can be off. And if all of a sudden the animal gets a sensory clue, then the grid cells re anchor properly again. they settle in the right position again. I've talked about this. You can do this experiment yourself. you get up in the, I've talked about this many times, you get up in the middle of the night and it's very dark, you have to be very completely dark or put a blindfold on or something. And you say, I'm at the edge of my bed, I'm going to start moving towards the bathroom. And as you walk, there's no sensory input. As you walk, your body, you have a sense of where you are in the room, oh yeah, I'm no longer at the corner of the bed, now I'm in the middle of the room, now I'm approaching the wall on the far side. This is path integration. And, but as you approach the wall on the far side, you have a lot of uncertainty. And you're like, oh, I don't really know where I am. I know I'm getting closer, but then you stick your hand out and you start reaching around trying to feel where the wall is because you don't want to walk into it because the path integration is, not, it's not terribly accurate. It's not, it's a noisy process and very quickly you you have enough error or noise in the signal, you get a little bit worried you're going to walk into something. it's a fun little experiment to do, and as soon as you touch the wall, then all your grid cells re anchor again, and then you know exactly where you are.

okay. Any questions on that? Yeah, so with the different grid cell modules with different scale and orientation, if you map it onto the brain, is it like in one direction the scale changes, and then in the orthogonal direction the orientation changes? No, an individual, if I, recall, and Hojae, if you know this, you should speak up because I know you have a lot of experience, but if I recall, the orientation is also something that gets locked in, by sensory input. It's, it can vary slightly, so the two grid cell modules that, that might be next to each other do not always have the same relative orientation. The relative orientation can change, under different environments.

I had a quick question. so in, in the neocortex is anchoring like identifying the pose of the object that you're looking at. Anchoring would be, imagine you're reaching your hand into a dark box and you're feeling it, there's one of ten objects in there, and you don't know which one you're feeling, right? And you start moving your finger around on it, and at some point you go, oh, I know which one, that, that's the, computer mouse. At that point, the grid cells in the cortex, our theory would say, that's the point where they anchored and said, okay, we're going to anchor correctly for the computer mouse. And if you recognize, you feel, oh no, this is the coffee cup, they would anchor it differently for the coffee cup. Yeah, maybe a bit like if you move on the coffee cup, as soon as you touch the handle, you you, know how to predict every other point on this mug. And identify the cup and its pose. It's interesting. One of the things I always found fascinating about this is that when, we'll get to this in a second, but when you, once you recognize the object, you also have recognized your location of the object. These are not two separate things. They have to go together. I'll explain why in a minute. but it's not oh, I'm on the coffee cup, but where am I? I don't know. It's more you know where you are and what you are at the same time. Because it turns out for every object, you're going to, you're going to anchor these grid cell modules differently. And therefore. you'll have a different location. So it's once you know what the object is, you anchor the grid cells. And once you anchor the grid cells, you know where you are. And so it's they're not two separate activities. I have a question. Yeah. which relationship is fixed versus not fixed? So is the scale between the different grid scales fixed or depending on situation? You said orientation is not fixed. Okay. the orientation, I think the scale, I believe, is fixed. within a grid cell module, the phase of individual cells are fixed as well. That's, that was, there was an experiment that proved that. so really the thing that varies over, when you're anchoring is just the, which of the actives, which of the cells that are currently active at some location in each module and also the orientation, between, of that particular module to the object that's being observed.

Yeah, this is still not a very good way of determining location, because if you think about it, take one grid cell module, you've got a bunch, you still don't, it's, you still, if I just look at one grid cell module, it doesn't tell me where I am in the environment, it tells me I'm at one of these locations, but it doesn't tell me where I am, but if you start looking at multiple grid cell modules, then, Then you can start really narrowing down where you are.

before I get to that, I have a, the next slide is that, this, let me show you this slide. This, I've shown this before, this is from this paper by this guy named Tank, and, I love this image. this shows you what they physically, what grid cells physically look like in the rat. I think it was a rat and it was a mouse, I think it was a rat. and this is like a slice in the, a slice through the enthorhinal cortex. and they're showing three different grid cell modules. This is the, physical, experiment. And, one module here, which has got all the colored dots in it, that's called module one. There's one, another module, which is this green line, that's another module, which is this yellow line. And these are three modules that change in scale. he's not showing the other ones. and then what does the actual really looking like in a grid cell module? It's a little bit complicated. first of all, imagine. that, a cell, remember a cell can fire in multiple places in an environment, right?

you can, I don't know how to describe this this little colored rhombus here, or rectangle, square, is representing all the places that, that can be represented by a grid cell, and then, but if you keep going along the surface, it repeats, right? So a cell might be active here on this upper left dark red one, but that same cell would be active over here on the next dark red one, the next one, and so on. so the repeating, so this is one non repeating, and this is the one element that shows all the different sort of phases within an element that repeats. I don't know if that's, it's confusing, but. And then, and so you can see a grid cell module actually, in this case, had six of those, phase, phaselets or whatever they're called, and so what, does that mean? It means these dots are actual individual cells, And, and they show where in space they respond. so imagine I'm a dark red cell here, can you see my mouse? that's one cell, and it will repeat over and over again. It will repeat over and over again as you move. There's another cell over here, a different cell, but it has the same phase as this cell. there's a bunch, there's six, There'll be six, in this case, roughly six cells that all respond in the same location in an environment. And you can imagine, as the animal is moving through the environment, there's a bump of activity in each one of these six, phase blocks. and it's it's just there's six copies of the grid cells, and so as you move, those, lumps, let's say the animal is moving, the lump moves across, and then it slides into the next one, and then it slides into the next one, the bump of activity as the animal moves. And of course, eventually it'll run off this end, but there'll be other ones that start on the other side, so you always have two or three of these lumps of activity, actually, six of them in this case, because there's going to be a lump in each one of these guys. So you wouldn't want to just have one set of grid cells, because when you run off one end, you have to start on the other end. And cells are noisy, so there's actually six copies of everything going on in one grid cell module. So that's just redundancy?

it's what's observed. it is, redundancy, but it could be more than redundancy. And we'll get to that in a minute.

but on this experiment, it looked redundant. Now I say that, because But there were some other interesting observations in this paper, which suggest it is more than redundant. And I've talked about this in the past too, so some of you will remember this. Some of these cells, let's take, can you see my mouse here at this range? I'm just highlighting a cell here, and I hope you can see my mouse. Yes, I can see it. And, it's amazing, let's take this cell. And when the animal was in a particular environment, For some reason, some of these cells just would never fire. Like this particular one, not all the dark red ones, but this particular one didn't fire when you would expect it to fire. In other environments, it did fire, and it was consistent for the environment, meaning like in this particular environment A, that cell was never, it didn't fire, but in other, environments it did. and so this, was very a clue to me because it turns out if we want to have unique spaces for all the objects that we know, there aren't enough grid cell modules to do that.

We'll walk, through it in a moment. but we need, more than five or 10 grid cell modules to create large spaces for all the things that a column might know. And so there, there needs to be another layer of encoding going on. and it almost certainly is, and we have speculations of what it is. But this was a clue because, this was, this whole experiment was done in a very thin layer of cells. I think it was like, 10 microns thick or something like that. So you're just getting one thin layer of cells, of course, there's depth to this as well. And so the thought was that as you go deep into the tissue, you're going to find sparser codings of the same, of the same grid cells. And now all of a sudden you can start representing very much larger spaces. But that was speculation, but there was this, one empirical clue where he did find these cells that were consistently inactive when they should have been active on particular environments, and that was like a clue that, yeah, there's some other encoding going on here, that we need to, that allows the system to be more powerful.

I warned you this is a really complex topic, and it is, so I'll keep going, and, I can go as deep as you want to know about some of these, questions. Now, I want to just bop back up here. This, figure is from our paper, we, what we call the frameworks paper, and, this is showing a couple of things. first of all, just to start with the figure A, this is your classic single cell grid cell module, so we've been talking about that, and we put a little rat here to show that as the rat's moving around this box, at different points, this cell fires. I can see it there. And then the second B here is showing two cells in the same grid cell modules that are just shifted by phase. so a blue cell and a brown cell, but the same basic idea we talked about before. And of course there'd be a set of cells, and everywhere in this environment there'd be some sets, some cells that are firing from this grid cell. We're only showing two. All right, so now imagine we have, go to C, and there's, two grid cell modules shown here, one in the brown or red and one in the green, and these grid cell modules have different orientation and different, spacing, or scale. And if I were to say, okay, if I were to look at one grid cell module, it doesn't tell me too much where I am, it's some but not too much, and the green, and if I look at the other grid cell module, it doesn't tell me too much, but if I overlay the two, and you look at cells in both, then it turns out that, at any point in time, there'll be one cell in this upper grid cell module and one cell in this lower grid cell module that are active coincidentally, and, that is a much more unique location than in each individual grid cell. so of course there's always some cell in grids, this upper grid cell module is active, there's always some cell in this lower grid cell module is active, it's just which of those two cells that are active at the same time as you move about is quite unique. If I move, if I, and if I move around in this environment, it won't repeat in the same sort of hexagonal pattern we saw here. These, the, the, this coincidence, these new cells will be much, much, occur much, much less often. So this is the basic idea how you can take multiple grid cell modules. And if you look at the active cells in each one, they don't tell you too much, but if you look at 'em together, they create a much more unique. location. So now imagine if I had something like, 20 or, 30 grid cells, let's say 20 grid cell modules. Each one, let's say had 30 cells that, that represented different locations. So the, the tiling was done by 30 cells in each grid cell module.

if you want to, what's the size of the space it could represent? It's basically 30 to the 20th power. It's like you can take one of the 30 cells in a grid cell module, one grid cell module, one of the 30 cells in the other grid cell module, one of the 30, and you anchor all those at the same time, it's essentially like it's 30th, it's 20th, different locations you can, represent, which is a pretty big number. And, and so if you have multiple grid cell modules. and they're all slightly different, either slightly different orientation, or slightly different phase, or slightly different scale. you can represent a very large space by looking at multiple cells, across the grid cell modules. yeah. I guess this is why I was asking, like, how the orientation change is, distributed over, the brain area. It's so over how big of an area would some coincidence detector need to integrate this information? Since, if the scale changes, in one direction and then orientation, I'm not sure how this is distributed, do we need to get long range connections to detect these coincidences? you can look at this figure here, you can see the scale bar here, 120 microns.

in this particular case, this is the enthorhinal cortex, if you said, oh, if I wanted to go, in this direction and, integrate 20 different grid cell modules, which I don't think there are 20 grid cell modules, you might have to go over a couple of millimeters, which is a lot. and so I don't think that's what's happening.

I think that within a particular.

you can almost think of this grid cell module here, you can think of this as the base of a proto column in the enthorhinal cortex. Let's see, it's maybe it's like a half millimeter by half millimeter or something like that. and so I think that the, We originally said, oh, wouldn't it be great if we could just integrate it across all these grid cell modules that are scaling across the surface of the enthorhinal cortex. There aren't enough grid cell modules to do that, and it's too long a distance. And so there has to be more to it, and there is. It's, there's a lot more going on than I've just shown you here. what I'm really showing you here is what experimentalists have shown initially, but it gets more complicated, so I actually believe that the, higher, the, encoding that we're talking about is, when we talk about, locking in on a particular, part of space, it's actually not even represented by these grid cells. It's represented by something else. I can get into it in a bit. Maybe I should wait to the end because it's pretty speculative.

I can talk about it now. I don't have a picture for it. Oh, we can talk about it in the end. It's fine. Okay, just remember about it in a second. Okay. Anyway, so this is the basic idea, and we didn't come up with this idea for how, that you could create these large spaces. We really liked it. That's really cool. And, we kept our fingers crossed, oh, we'll find, hopefully we'll find enough grid cell modules that we can make this work. And the more and more the research came out, it didn't look like there were really enough grid cell modules that, there might be five to eight of them or something like that, and it was like, oh,, that's not, that's not really enough.

but that was what was in our paper. Quick question. Yeah. so about this, but isn't there actually more locations that can be encoded? Because the, like in A, the firing field of a single grid cell in a module, like each one of those, like the, excuse me, the overlap in D, it's actually two SDRs overlapping, based on the previous picture? it's not really SDRs, it's two Sorry, it's the sparse. Really, it's just, it's two active cells. It's just two active cells, one active cell from module C, the red one up in C, like the upper one, and one from the red one, and one from the green one. These are just two individual cells that happen to be firing at the same time, and when those two cells fire at the same time, it's not really an SDR, it's just a coincidence of two cells. So we actually need a lot more than that. we need at least 20, active cells to detect a coincidence, because we're going to have some neuron that's going to do this. yeah. So one of the dots here corresponds to just one of the dots on the previous picture. Okay. Got it. Understood. Thank you. These are, the, on the on D, we're looking at the activity of two individual cells and where do those cells become active? As the animal moves in this box and the green cell becomes active in the green points and the red cell becomes active in the red points, and this one location, the green and the red cell are active at the same time. And individually the green and the red cells don't tell you too much. Because they're repeating over this environment, but when you look at them together, it tells you oh, I know, in this case, I know exactly where I am, because that's the only place that the green and the red run at the same time. Bear in mind that at any point in the box, there will be one red cell and one green cell active. So there will always be a coincidences between one of those two cells, between one cell in module A and one in module 2. So there will always be a coincidence someplace, and so you, looking at these two grid cell modules, you could tell where you are in this box much more precisely than you could by looking at the individual module.

So what do you mean when you said there's not enough modules? Not enough for what? first of all, you don't want anything to rely on just two cells. And, but really what you want, if I'm going to detect a pattern among a bunch of neurons, I want at least 20 cells active, at least, for, so that, a dendrite could, or a cell could recognize a pattern. If I want to, imagine these grid cells are being, are in the layer six in our cortex and we're sending them up to layer four. I want to be able to say, oh, this sensory input is at this location on the object. I need to have a, I need to have enough cells to do that, I can't recognize the location of just two cells. cells are not always reliable, they die, they, the neurons aren't good at recognizing, they need 15 active synapses at once to do anything. So I need a bunch of, I need a bunch of grid cell modules, or something like them, so that I can recognize the location. Also, with, the number of grid cell modules that we actually observe. And I'm sorry, I think it's eight, but I'm not sure. that doesn't create a very large space. Imagine I said, now I could say, oh, it's 30 to the eighth power. That's not that big. I'd a, I'd like a bigger space. I'd like, the space to be unique for all objects. I want to have, I want to have a very unique space that I'm saying like, I'll never get confused when I have a coincidence of cells, it's going to be like, oh, this object on this location.

I really want. Higher, more modules, more, I need more cells active to recognize it, and I need more cells to create a, guarantee I'll have a unique location in the world. I guess just to clarify, because I guess the, like the redundancy you were showing with the tank paper would help slightly with the first problem. In terms of the number of cells, but it's still the issue, as you were saying, that you have to integrate over a huge area. You're on good point, Niels. That's right. When we wrote this paper, we didn't know about the six phaselets. That was a new discovery the tank came up with. so we actually might have six cells that are active in each grid cell module, but that doesn't really make the space any larger. Now again, if I could selectively deactivate individual grid cells under different contexts, then I'd have a much larger space, then it would be like, oh, this cell only fires in certain locations and, anyway, there's a lot of confusion about this, how this actually works. we made the argument in this paper that, that, a rat moving in two rooms, and these two rooms are both rectangular rooms, but one has a blue object on the wall, one has a green object on the wall, and the rat will see these as two different rooms. the same locations in these rooms will be encoded completely different. so here's location A, B, and C, and in a different room you'd have a different set of cells, active D, E, and F. In fact, all the locations in this room will not, will be completely different encodings in all locations in this room, even though the two rooms are the same, essentially, size. This also issues, illustrates a point of path integration, meaning if an animal goes from A to C, or indirectly goes to A to B to C, it doesn't matter, whenever you're in C you have the same encoding for that location. it doesn't matter how you got there. Now we said, okay, this is what's going on in the cortex, but let's imagine your finger is not, is now the mouse, and the finger is moving around in the world, just like the mouse is moving around in the boxes, and you can talk points and objects, like this point here, we'll label it X, another point Y, another point Z, that's very equivalent to A, B, and C, and here's a different object. And different points, and you can path integrate, as you're moving from V to T, you pass through other points like W. It doesn't matter how you move from V to T, any direction you'll end up with the same encoding once you get up here. So that's the whole path integration component of this. Anyway, so this is the basic idea, the foundation principle of the thousand brains theory, is that, moving our sensors through the world, a sensor patch, is very much like a rat moving around in an environment. It's the same idea, the same basic principle, the same neural mechanisms underlying it, and just like there are head direction cells that indicate which way the rat is facing in this room, we have orientation cells which represent which way the sensor patch is rotated.

on the object. that was the frameworks paper, which was the first time we really spelled this all out, completely. Okay, I debated why I wanted to talk about this topic, because it gets, really complicated, but, it's a big part of the literature, so I thought I'd mention it, but if you don't follow it all, that's okay too. There's a question about how do grid cells work? How do they do this? How do they actually path integrate? How does the animal moving in the dark, why does the cell change? What's causing the cell to change to say I'm in a new location? what, is doing that? It's not any kind of input from the sensors. There's something internally as the rat moves, that causes grid cells to change. So this figure is trying to show how a single grid cell Moving in one direction, why it would become active, then inactive, then active, then inactive. That's what it would do, right? If you're moving across an environment, like in the bottom right here, if the, animal's moving, it would say the cell become active, inactive, active, inactive, active. Even if the animal was moving in a sort of strange direction, it would be like active, and then active again. we have to, there's, people wonder how could this be? And there's a number of things that point to this particular mechanism, and it's really simple and it's beautiful. I really like it. That's why I wanted to put it in here. there's basically two frequencies that are going on. There's one called the baseline frequency, which is just constantly going on. This is the theta frequency in the enthorhinal cortex, I think. And it's at something like 8 hertz or 10 hertz, something like that. And then there's another frequency. That was red. Another one is the green one. and this is VCO. That stands for velocity controlled oscillator or velocity controlled oscillator, excuse me. And this is, the same frequency as the red one, but, it's, the frequency varies based on the velocity of the animal moving. So there are cells that represent how fast an animal is moving. And if you could create another oscillator that was that, that sped up or slowed down based on how fast the animal is moving in a particular direction, it would achieve the results we want. So these two oscillators, imagine they, they get added together and so you end up with a, carrier wave of this purple one at the top. Where at some points they're aligned and you get more activity, and other points are just, they're antiphase and you get no activity. And as the, this is all, now imagine you're a single cell, and you're a single cell looking at these two frequencies. One, they're coming in, they could be, they don't have to be on synapses even, they could be just basic frequencies in the background, but we'll come back to that in a moment maybe. But anyway, you're looking at these two frequencies. When these two frequencies align, you're much more likely to become active, and when they're disaligned, you're less likely to become active. And if the animal still is not moving, then the two frequencies would be exactly the same, and your activity won't change. If you're active, you'll be active. If you're disactive, But as soon as the animal starts moving, the frequency of this green one shifts, It changes, and now, your activity will change over time. And the faster the animal is going, the bigger the frequency shift on the green one, the more rapidly your activity will change from active to disactive, So essentially, you're taking a velocity controlled oscillator and turning it into an on and off signal, which corresponds to how far the animal has moved in a particular direction.

this is, I believe, there's a couple of theories about how grid cells work. This is by far the better one, and, almost certainly true.

there's an interesting, observation that comes out of this, if you're following this, still following this. When, the two have the maximum, the two, the green and the red, have the maximum, sum, it where it is relative to the baseline frequency changes. You can see that right here, these vertical lines, you see this vertical line is just to the left of the peak here, now here it's right on the peak, and now here it's to the right of the peak. This is just a natural way that this, oscillatory interference works, is that where the actual peak is It shifts relative to the peak of the baseline frequency. And what this means is that as the animal is moving through an environment, both for the grid cells and the place cells, You'll see that the cell starts to fire in advance of when the animal actually gets to the preferred location. And it's, what they call a phase precession. It starts out on the far side of the peak, and then as you pass through it, it's right on the peak, and as you've gone beyond it, it's to the left of the peak. So there's actually additional information here about where the animal is. these, prior spikes here, these prior peaks here are shifted in phase relative to the baseline. This is observed, this is a fact, so this is a very big important clue that this is what's going on inside of this, and this is a simple mechanism by which, basically once you can take a, if you can get movement and turn it into a frequency shift, then, and you compare it to a base frequency, you can get grid cell activity. This shows one cell. going in one direction only. But, we can go in multiple directions. So the basic idea here is you have to have multiple velocity control oscillators in different directions of activity. and that's what's represented by these lower ones in B here. And so a cell actually looks at Not just one green velocity control oscillator, but multiple green velocity control oscillators. and if you sum all these up, you'll get the grid cell pattern. You'll get this activity of a cell. So this means that There have to be multiple, you should be able to find these, cells that represent activity in different directions, and they should control velocity controlled oscillators in different directions.

and so scientists have looked for them, there's two basic hypotheses. The one I like the best is that these correspond to actually mini columns in the lower layers, that the mini columns are directionally sensitive to, the cells in the minicolumn are directionally sensitive, and, this is getting really deep here, but you need, actually, to get this to work for one, this is just one grid cell. To get to work for all the grid cells, you actually have to have, you have to have, these velocity control loss studies have to have different peaks. You have to have a set of them, you have to have a set of them in each direction. So imagine I have a mini column that's got, let's say, ten cells in it, and each one is responding to, the whole mini column is responding to moving in one direction. And we see this. This is observed, right? So these cells all want to respond maximally when you're moving in some of the directions in. Okay. in space. this is in V1 and V2 and things like that. And, what you need is you need a set of cells, each shifted in phase from each other, that are all the same velocity controlled oscillator. So one of the hypothesis, which we've never written down, is that within a mini column in the lower layers, You have all these cells responding at the same, to the same, basically, movement in the same direction, but they might be offset by a phase, and, which then will provide the input you need to create grid cells.

yeah. mechanistically, it seems pretty straightforward to generalize this to three dimensional spaces, but Right. I know that's not really observed, but do you have any idea why not? Because it seems like really easy to generalize that. I agree. So I thought the same thing. I said, okay, maybe the enthorhinal cortex is not very good at three dimensional spaces because it wasn't evolved for that. but in the cortex, why not, right? Why couldn't every mini column be representing a direction in three dimensional space?

and now you have a basis set of movement vectors in three dimensions, or n dimensions, and, and then whatever they represent, that's what you would do, right? That's, they would work. I agree.

and the question is, where do these, Where do these come from? Where do these, what, are these hard coded? These, directionally sensitive, mini columns? And that's a debatable question. I like to think that they're not hard coded. I like to think that they're learned.

and I've made the argument in the past that, the retina has all the information you need to determine whether you're moving forward or backwards or turning left or right or going up and down. In fact, the argument, I would think the simplest explanation is that the retina sends these magnocellular cells, which are just on off cells, and the cortex has to figure out, turn them into minicolumns that represent directions of movement. So if you ran the, these magnocellular on off cells through a spatial pooler, you would end up with multidimensional representations of direction. That is, whatever the data contains coming from the retina, if it's three dimensional, it would represent three dimensions. If it was two dimensions, it would represent two dimensions. A spatial pooler would do that. It seems like it. So if we assume the system learns and the information is coming in the way we think it learns, I don't see why it wouldn't represent three dimensions.

or if the data was N dimensional, it would represent N dimensions, but we typically don't get that from our retina.

if some of you might know in the enthorhinal, in the grid cell literature itself, so now we're going back to the enthorhinal cortex, they've done a whole bunch of experiments to see can grid cells represent three dimensional space. So they've done experiments where rats are climbing around on lattices in three dimensions. That wasn't very definitive. Then they did experiments with bats. And these are amazing experiments. They have the bats flying through these very long, large tunnels. like, a quarter mile long. And the bat, they're recording from the cells in the, bat's entorhinal cortex as it's flying through this space. It's amazing. And they can see, where in the three dimensional space of the tunnel or the environment that the bat is. And, and they say, okay, do the grid cells represent three dimensional space or not? And what they found, which is a little disappointing, they found that, the grid cells work the way you would expect them to work based on landmarks on the ground. the grid cells represent a nice two dimensional map of the, surface of the, Earth, in some sense, while the bat is flying. The grid cells do become active in, vertical dimensions as well. But they lose all of their normal grittiness. They no longer act in some sort of regular way, like a cell that becomes active at some point up in space is no longer has the same scale, and, phase or orientation. It's it's wonky. So the grid cells, they still become active in three dimensions. But they just, the third dimension just messes them all up and doesn't look right, so no one knows what to make of that. But I still like to believe that in the cortex it can be three dimensions, and I don't see any problem with it in terms of Monty. Even if it's not that way in the brain, I don't see why Monty has to, stick to this historical artifact of 2D. All right, so that's oscillatory interference there is another theory called, continuous attractor networks. and just in case you know that, it does, it tries to represent, recreate the same basic behavior of grid cells, but it takes far too many neurons to do it. It just, there's not enough neurons to make it work. It's complicated, but someone made an argument, there's a paper where they argue that both are under, that both oscillatory interference and continuous attraction networks are both active, and that's, and I think that was the right argument. The reason I said this is because if you look at this system right here, when the animal stops moving, What actually happens is these velocity control oscillators stop firing altogether. And so the, there would be no persistence of memory as to where the animal is. That is, this works for path integration as the animal is moving, but when the animal stops moving, these signals disappear, and, and then you might not remember where you are. And so the, you need a, you need an attractor network to lock in cell activity even when the animal's not moving. And so okay, we'll stop here and keep everybody active.

and then we'll continue moving again in the future. So the argument was made by one researcher that the combination of, to change the attractor network for, Permanence, and oscillatory interference for path integration is the right answer, and I think that's probably right.

It's all complicated. oh, so now I've gone through most of my stuff. Go ahead, you have a question? yeah, probably just wild speculation, asking you to wildly speculate. So can, good, because abstract knowledge, right? So looking at this representation here, it seems like you can create a grid and n dimensional, like you were saying, and is, that a path to representing any abstract knowledge spaces?

yes, the answer is yes, and there's a fair amount of research on this as well. first of all, the enthorhinal cortex is known to represent all kinds of things, Not just where you are, but it seems in front of general maps, remember the hippocampal complex, which includes the hippocampus and the enthorhinal cortex, is where we store our short term memories. Things like, your episodic memories, too. and it's not just, like, where you are, it's what did you do? What did you have for breakfast? And so on. So all these things are stored in these same cells. In fact, with all this research, it says that the, the grid cells and the place cells somehow are able to encode all kinds of stuff. And even the same exact cells are able to encode different types of things. So the basic belief is that they're this representation of space. is underlying, all kinds of, both time and space, and all kinds of things you might call abstract type of stuff. I don't know the current research on that, it's a little confusing, but this is clearly happening. I've speculated that, in, in the cortex, if we, try to understand abstract spaces, The only thing that's, the only thing we have to explain is what is the equivalent of the velocity controlled oscillator, like what is movement when you're thinking about politics, what is movement when you're thinking about mathematics, you're not physically moving something, but you are, you need to store information at different locations and therefore you have to do some sort of path integration or some sort of, and it's very confusing. I've argued and I wrote in, my latest book that, that, you might think of, a mathematical operator, as a type of movement. You might say, when I do some transform or I do an add property or something like that's like a movement, and if I, and therefore, by performing some operation, you're actually moving to a different space. And you're sorting the locations in the different spaces. It's not clear at all exactly how this occurs, but it is clear that this mechanism is underlying it all. I think that's very, extremely likely that the same mechanism is underlying all kinds of Our thinking processes, all of them actually, it's, so it's a bit of a puzzle, oh, exactly how does it do that? I don't know, but it's doing it. It's clear that it's doing it. It's not, there's no other mechanisms anywhere. you look at cortex, it's cortex. It doesn't look like it's going to be different anywhere else. And we know the enthorhinal cortex does multiple things. So it clearly can, almost seems It almost seems like we, even with abstract concepts and spaces, we try to map them onto to a three dimensional space. Like even when we think about math, we usually try to visualize it and plot it somehow like a 3d, like it's really hard to think about concepts that are in higher than three dimensional spaces. And even when we talk, we usually use like metaphors, that talk in. terms of spatial navigation and movement.

it's clear the brain wants to drop things into this mechanism because that's all it has. And, and everything humans do, it, works to some extent. it's interesting to speculate, you think about the, transformer networks, the large language models, and they're so good at language, they're better than humans in many ways, in some ways the worst, but better than humans in many ways. And why would that be? It might be because language is somewhat, is a poor fit for this mechanism.

this is the mechanism that evolved to explore environments and, objects and so on, and, we're shoehorning, language onto it, and we're proud of it as humans, but, maybe the reason that ChatGPT or these large language models are better at just modeling language because that's what they're designed for. They would do terrible at this kind of stuff, recognizing, fill a coffee cup, they can't do that at all. But, but, maybe if you design an algorithm that's just for language, it can be better than us because we're shoehorning language into this mechanism, and that's why math is hard. It's a lot, calculators have no trouble with math. We do. So it's because we're fitting all the stuff in. Now this is not, bad news for the thousand brains project because The bottom line, we're going to want to create intelligent machines that interact with the world. And if you're going to create intelligent machines that interact with the world, this is the way to do it. You don't want to use a large language model, you know, you don't want to use transformers.

our project, the Thousand Brain Project, is really biased towards robotics and physical manipulation of the world, and can do other things too, but it may not, it may never equal, the language abilities of, ChatGPT.

but we'll, it'll understand what a cat is and then what it feels and how it sounds and, have deep, it will have real knowledge of the world as opposed to just knowledge through correlations. Okay, so let's see how we did on my, it take a long time here. I just wanna point out a few things here. the unknown section here, we talked it, we just talked about, are they 2D, 3D or nd we just talked about that. I'd like to point out that in, in the neocort, I mean in the entorhinal cortex. You don't find just grid cells and place cells, and, head direction cells. You find the majority of cells are combinations of these things. I think the word is conjunctive. I have to look that up. I think that was the word for it.

there, that most cells are somewhat like grid cells and also somewhat like head direction cells and other things. It's not this huge mixture of in between stuff. And there's other cells that are like, instead of just being place cells, they're like object oriented, object vector cells and border cells, and these cells that seem to respond to particular things in environments. So it's much, it's a messy mix of stuff. and scientists want to, they look for the griddiest grid cells when they want to do grid cell research because the other ones are half grid cells and half direction cells and, it's a mess. it's just one, but that's a misleading picture I just showed you. It's like all these other cells that are in between these things. I also talked about in the tank paper how sometimes grid cells don't behave the way they're supposed to behave. There could be a lot of those. and then we've already touched on this, but the, place cell and the grid cell interaction in the hippocampal complex is very much analogous to the layer 4 to layer 6A interaction in the thousand brains theory, and, and we speculated that layer 6B is orientation and that would be like head direction cells, in the entorhinal, in the, hippocampal complex. So this is a very strong analogy. It seems it's, almost certainly correct. And that's how we do this all the same. So that's all I was going to present about grid cells at the end of my talk. Question for the conjunctive cells. Is that, like you said, there's a mess there, some of them do a little bit of a bunch of things. Is that a biological constraint? do they grow like that? Or is that, exposure to environment and they settle? I don't know. I assume it's part of the mechanism.

I assume it's part of the mechanism. let me just, I talked about grid cells on their own are not really sufficient for representing the spaces we need. They're just not enough grid cell modules. And if I think a grid cell module is really just one grid cell module, it's equivalent to what you get in one cortical column. There's just not enough cells, grid cells, to make the space.

we do know that there are these, there have to be, cells that are, velocity, directionally sensitive, phase shifted, cells. We know, we have observed these conjunctive cells, which are combinations of gridiness and direction. And it seems to be clear that when we actually recognize a location in space, we're not really just looking at the grid cells, we're looking at all these other cells. That is, layer 4 is not just looking at the output of the equivalent grid cells in layer 6, it's looking at the equivalent of all these cells in layer 6. There's a lot of other cells down there that are going to be doing these weird things, and somehow the combination of them is unique.

and I don't have a better answer to that right now. so I think it's more that it's part of the mechanism. it's not, yeah, what they, represent is going to be learned, but the fact that there's direction cells and grid cells and there's combinations of them, I think is going to be part of the evolutionary mechanism. It's not, and then, I don't know if, yeah, that was a good segue, but you mentioned earlier that at the end you could talk a bit more about how, you feel like, yeah, encoding of unique locations might actually happen in cortex, given the limitations about number of cells and things like that.

again, go back to, let's see here, I don't have a good picture of it, but, remember I said these are like, these could be like cells in individual mini columns. And they're directionally sensitive. And then I said if in a minicolumn you have to have multiple cells at different phase shifts, if I'm going to get a complete grid cell module, I have to have cells at all different phases of the theta cycle in a minicolumn. So I might have 10 cells or 20 cells that are all firing at the same, velocity controlled, velocity controlled oscillator frequency, but they're going to be shifted from each other. So if I wanted to, if I looked at those cells. Again, I'm looking at all the different cells in the minicolumns, and the minicolumns are representing different directions of motion. A grid cell, would, in some sense, if I could look at all the activity across the, say, some of these minicolumns are active and some of them aren't, and I look at all the cells in those minicolumns, and they're all phase shifted, but they're all, I would have a unique coding for location. I'd have plenty. I'd have, for example, even in a, even if I have, if I assumed my minicolumn was a half a millimeter by a half millimeter, I might have 100 to 100, let's say 100 to 120 minicolumns. Each minicolumn may have 20 cells. And, and so maybe, maybe a third of those minicolumns would be active, so I might have, say, 40, and times 20, I might have 800 active cells at that point in time that are representing, that I could impose a unique location for. That is, if I looked at which cells are in phase, aligned in phase right now in these different mini columns, that would be the, that's, at least that's the information I need to update my, it's it, that would be all the information I need to know where, I am in this object, in which direction I'm moving. It would encode both of those. Those, 80 cells or whatever I came up with, the 40 times 20. 800 cells. Those cells, if I looked at which ones are in phase at any point in time, they would uniquely code a space and a direction, a highly unique space, a location in a particular object in a particular direction of movement. So the information is encoded there. It's not in the form I want it, but it's there. It is, and I got a lot of all those. All those minicolumns can anchor differently. That is, which cell is currently in phase with the baseline frequency, it could, that is the anchoring process. So I basically, I have a hundred, 40 active minicolumns in, and I get to pick, which of the 20 cells are in lock and phase at this moment with the baseline, that's, 20 to the 40th power of unique codings at that point in time. so the information is there. how it gets extracted, how it gets, the problem, as I said earlier, one of the problems is that when you stop moving, that information would be unique, plus direction. So I don't want to just, I want to have a way of not being, I don't always want it to be direction sensitive. I'm talking sloppily here, but if we wanted to, we could have a little brainstorming session. We could try to walk through exactly what would be required. to get the information we need. But my point is, there is enough information in these cells to encode exactly where I am on a particular object with high, with a high space, very high dimensional spaces.

And in these, cells and these mini columns, which are required to generate grid cells, would have the information required. Again, it may not be in the form we want it. but it's there.

that to me is okay, we're not really, we're not combining all these grid cell modules, we're actually combining the information across multiple mini columns. And there's 120, a minimum of 100 mini columns in a small cortical column, so that's enough.

Yeah, I think that would be interesting to talk a bit more in detail at some point. because yeah, I'd also be curious to better understand like how we could do path integration in these like n dimensions without, Having to create the grid cells, like the end dimensional grid cell or whatever. I think because if you move, if these are unidirectional, then like even just in the simple case, you move right and then move back like the same, you won't have, that's why I said the information is there, but it's not in the form you want it, because those minicolumns would be directionally sensitive. the hand wavy argument I have near Niels is the following. To me, what we actually see is grid cells. this is the output of the continuous attractor network. It is the, it's the memory of where we are at some point in time that persists even though, even when I stop moving. And, but the actual encoding of space is not in the grid cells. And so somehow if I start, if I move in one direction I try to move back in the other direction, I have a completely different set of cells that are active in the mini columns because different sets of mini columns are active. And, and so what's required is that somehow we, we anchor the, second set of mini, the new reverse set of mini columns, we have to anchor them, appropriately. and, so I have to have memory of what that should have been. And somehow, in some, a hand wavey form, I would say the grid cells are the, are somehow we saying, okay, we're here right now. we're gonna lock down. Now if I start moving in another direction, I have to reinstate the active, the active cells in the mini columns, in the basic phases. And so there, it's yes, it's a combination of these two things, like a. a permanent memory or memory that stays some stays active allows me to reinstate the phases that I need for path integration. it's a combination of this oscillatory interference, which is very specific, directional specific, and, and the grid cells, which are more like a continuous attractor network type of behavior. But this is all very hand wavy, but what I feel good about it, Niels, is that I think the information is there. It's not if I couldn't, if I couldn't figure out how this could possibly be represented, I'd be nervous about it, but it's oh, no, it's there, and these things are all observed, and this phase procession is observed, and, these velocity controlled oscillators are observed.

and grids, they're there, it must happen with inside of a mini, inside of a cortical column, so the information is there somehow. And, and even if we don't understand all the details yet, I'm sure they're, it's understandable somehow. Cool, thanks. I have a question about velocity, velocity itself is not a, if that's a calculated quantity, it's not a primary signal, like if you're in, if you're moving in the dark, you can't see or feel how fast you're moving, so how does that come about? I don't know the answer to that question. I would suspect initially, this might have been, hardwired from an animal, like a rat moving in an environment. It could be a hard coded, Somehow, it's subcortical. it's, clearly there. it's, I don't know how the neurons calculate it, but when the animal starts walking, these things change. so there has to be some way of doing that, that doesn't rely on sensory input. I'm not worried about that because that could be a very, hard coded evolutionary, thing. When it comes to So it's just calculated from motor, I don't know, subcortical motor system, right? Subcortical motor system, I don't know how it does it. you, I think some people Oh, I think in the MEC, I think, besides grid cells, place cells, head direction cells, like some people say there's also like speed cells and maybe it might be related to that. There aren't, that's what it is, but so they're there. The question is, I think the question was, how do those speed cells get, How do they know how fast you're moving? That's a research question for somebody. But I would, my argument is it's, not, a generic algorithm. It's probably a hard coded thing that animals had to evolve at some point. you can imagine. You can imagine, a little animal that's just walking in one direction, and somehow the, there's a signal that says, move your legs, and that, and move them faster, move them slower, and then that signal becomes the, velocity, it becomes, I don't know, it doesn't bother me. Also for, machine dead reckoning, it typically is gyroscopes, which has this internal only. And for human equivalent, could be vestibular system as well, so as you're moving forward. Yeah, that's a good point. That gives you like an internal gyroscope. exactly. I'm reminded about my vestibular system after I had my bike accident, because it got messed up, and boy, did I have some bad vertigo. Yeah, but that's an accelerometer, not a velocimeter. yeah, but you could use, you could, use that to, to, set a constant speed and then, change it, who knows? It's it must be learned, at least in some cases, like when you start driving a car, you have a model of velocity there, even though we couldn't possibly have evolved that. Yeah, good point. And, you could fool people, talk about the, the, you, only detect acceleration, with your vestibular system. But yeah, it's very easy to fool people. You can ac you know, in, in these theaters that have three to, like these moving seats and so on or whatever. You can accelerate someone quickly and then slow it down and they still perceive that they're moving. You know what I'm saying? You can fool the body into thinking you're still moving based on just acceleration.

so anyway, there's a lot of ways to do it. I do think, it's interesting, again, I love the fact, thinking about the retina, because it's clear that we get all this information from the retina, that again, if you imagine you're just watching someone playing a first person video game, and you, know how that person is moving, you know if they're moving forward, backwards, jumping, turning their head, ducking, you just, you know all this stuff, and it's all coming from the visual signal. And, as they're walking forward, you know that, you, your grid cells are updating as you're doing that, even though you're not controlling anything. So it's all coming from the visual signal. And as far as we know, the visual signal from the retina is just these on off cells that, and so it's able to say it's able to take patterns that are changing on the retina and seeing which ones are turning on and off. And the relative distribution, across the space of the retina. And, turn that into a very clear signal. You're moving forward, you're moving backward, you're turning left, you're turning right, you're looking up and down. it's there. So all that has to, that is not, that information has to be decoded from these on off signals. And almost certainly it's learned in the cortex. I just think it's another place like, wow, isn't that interesting? you can determine your movement just from these. bits turning on and off in your, visual space is all very clear. Yeah, I guess I, I think of movement as not just the grid cells and the place cells, but all other information, sensory information that we're getting, what Tristan mentioned about vestibular system and what you just mentioned, I guess it's optical flow, information. And I even, I guess proprioception and. Even, signals that we send to our muscles can probably tell us something about, I'm not sure, actually. Maybe not that one. I'm looking up the, I want to go to the, our, our page. Just a note on the vestibular system. It is awful at, estimation, by the way. Like the first thing you learn for flying is to not rely on your vestibular system and to just ignore it completely because it will crash. Yes. And if you're truly isolated and just have your vestibular system, it is terrible at figuring out what's actually going on. I'm trying to find our paper that we've been working on. I haven't looked at it in a while. I think if you go on TBT paper drafts.

oh, here we go.

and I want to show you this, this figure that's compiling it. it looked like you had it open as a PDF, too, actually. Oh, did I? I looked for it, I didn't see it. TBT paper drafts 15. Oh, right there. Oh, you're so much more observant than I am.

thank you. What would I do without you guys? I'm going to show you this figure in here.

Come on, fasten that.

Oh, did I do it? Is that, no, keep going here.

Here, this figure.

and this, and then zoom this in. You guys can see this, right? Yeah, thank you. so this is the figure from this paper, and notice here, we're showing, this is like a V1 column, and we're showing two inputs to it. One is the green one, it's like the sensory feature, and the other is their sort of motor signal, which is updating the grid cells, if you will. And, I show there's multiple sources for that, right? One is I show from the retina itself, this large red arc suggests that this, these are the magnocellular cells that are detecting motion on the retina, which is ground truth. So the eye movement ground truth from the magnocellular cells. But I also, we also know that projecting to the exact same cells in the thalamus, So this goes through the thalamus when we're arguing that the thalamus changes the orientation of these signals. the exact same signal, there's the superior colliculus projects to the same cells that the magnocellular cells. So the, relay cells in the thalamus get input from, they get input from the retina, but they also get input from the superior colliculus, they also get input from the vestibular system. these are known connections, in some sense, all these are valid sources of, movement data. the vestibular system does project to LGN in the thalamus, and it would say, hey, given your head movement, I think, you're, changing the orientation of your head. And this is what messed up when I had my accident, I messed up my vestibular system. This happens to anyone who gets dizzy, and so the vestibular system is sending incorrect signals saying the world that you're turning your head when you're not, and then the thalamus tries to correct that orientation so it starts to rotate the signal and it looks like the world is rotating because the vestibular system says your head is moving. And so the world starts spinning around because the thalamus is trying to compensate for the head moving, which isn't occurring. My point is there's multiple sources. there are many different sources that can provide the movement data. and if you just look at what the inputs to the, relay cells are in the thalamus, you can see the different sources. Also the motor efference copy, like from the motor output. That's from the Superior Colliculus. Oh, also this one. I don't know if that, but that doesn't affect column one, right? Yeah, to column two, So there you go. On this signal right here, this is the same, Oh, no, wait a second. This one here. This one here comes out. And it then becomes also an input to these relay cells, in the next ones, right? that's the other, that's the other input. this column can say, oh, I'm telling you to move, I'm telling you to move the eyes, and it says, okay, I'll take that information and I'll assume you're moving the eyes. Anyway, the point is, there's lots of sources of movement data. and when it comes to the thousand brains project, we have to be quite open to new ideas and things we can make up and stuff, we could do. We, don't have to stick to any of this if we can make up all the stuff we want to make up. Yeah. There's also direction selective retinal ganglion cells that project to the shell LGN, which project to layer 2 3. Is that right? I had read all these years that all the cells from the LG, from the retina were, center surround cells. And, but in rodents, they're directionally selective. Yeah. they have both. They have both types. Who does? The rodents? Rodents, too. Do humans have any directionally sensitive cells? I'm not aware of that. That's a good question. I don't know if they have been able to investigate that or not. it's not just humans, it's also monkeys. primates. So that, this is a very interesting point because you would think, why wouldn't the retina just tell you the direction it's moving? and therefore the cells coming off the back of the retina would be directionally sensitive cells. And we see that in simple mammals like rats and mice. but we don't see direction, as far as I know, there's, they don't see directionally sensitive cells coming off the primate retina, which tells you, this is really cool because it. It gets back to what, how many dimensions we can deal with. It says in the, in us, in other primates, the, actually determining which direction the head, the eye is moving. It's not determined, the eye doesn't tell you that. It has to be, it has to be calculated in the cortex itself. because the cortex is not, as far as the, ganglion cells in the retina and the relay cells in the thalamus are not directionally sensitive. And, but as soon as you get to the cortex, they are directionally sensitive. So it tells you that, it's taking this raw information, and then determining what are the possible movement vectors, whereas in the rat, it's more hard coded. It's more oh, I'm going to tell you what the movement vectors are. These are the movements you can make. it could be related to the fact that rodents rely so much more on the superior colliculus, that there has to be, it's more beneficial to them to have performed some of this direction selective stuff earlier in the pathway. Yeah, and they also have that kind of shallower visual hierarchy, which is like compressing everything. Again, it's, we go from this idea that the, this whole system started with navigation on surface of either the bottom of the ocean or the, land. And it was a two dimensional thing, really specifically designed for, getting to your shelter, finding food, getting back. And and then some, over time, it got more and more general purpose. and this is one of those things that makes it more general purpose. In the humans, we don't assume that, we don't make any assumptions about what that motion actually is. But this gets back to the, also the, interesting, about to the kind of idea of abstract thinking.

What, we're seeing here in, in Primates is that there is a, there's a more primitive signal, this center surround signal that again, it decoded in the cortex into okay, what are the directions existing actually moving? And one could imagine what if you lived in a four dimensional world and the retina viewed it? Would, the column learn to represent those four, four dimensions? because it makes no assumptions at all about the space, it just says, I'm going to start with a bunch of on off, standard surround bits, and we will deduce from that, what are the different directions we're moving. and, yeah. So anyway, I think we see this evolution from simple animals to more sophisticated mammals. where you get more general purpose principles, going on.

Pretty fascinating. I think so. I think all of these kinds of presentations always like at the end, it makes me appreciate like, wow, like the projects is amazing. Like getting all this information and making sense of it. And it's And it does it all within a single column.

it's amazing. it is pretty incredible. So I love that constraint. it's okay, it's going to have to happen. It's going to be there. It's there, we can find it. It's, these things all exist. yeah, again, I want to stress one more time, this, we want to understand this stuff, but then, we have to build systems that work on whatever principles we can build them, are more practical, and, we don't have to emulate all this stuff.

Which I think is, everyone understands it pretty well, but it's worth saying over and over again. I don't want anyone to say, oh my god, it's so complicated, how are we ever going to do this? we don't have to do all this. This is the way the neurons do it.

Yeah, thanks a lot for presenting this. This was a great discussion. And yeah, just a really nice overview. Okay. I, was worried it might be a little redundant for some people, but maybe, not. Yeah, I feel like every time we revisit this stuff, I learn something new. All right. Yeah, it's All right. it was fun doing.
