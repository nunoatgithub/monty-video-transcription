I hope my voice will stay with you through today's meeting. This is a bit different from the usual monthly review. I originally made an overview for myself, then felt inspired and thought it would be cool to share with all of you. It's basically an overview of how the Thousand Brains Project can have a positive impact on the world in the near, medium, and long term, and what kinds of applications we can already think of. We always say there will probably be tons of applications we can't even imagine right now, but there are already many things we can imagine that are not that far off. This shows how the things on our research roadmap play into actual impact in the real world.

I've structured this around a few key capabilities on the research roadmap: modeling, compositional objects, object behaviors, and being able to manipulate the world. Each of these key capabilities unlocks a new range of applications. Currently, we can do object and pose recognition. In terms of applications, this could be used within existing robotics pipelines such as manufacturing, where there are many papers trying to solve object and pose detection. There are lots of industrial applications where you need to detect parts and their pose, then have a gripper pick them up, or detect the pose of boxes so something can move them around in a warehouse. There are some current solutions, but it's definitely not a solved problem. They particularly struggle with changes in lighting, objects occluding each other, and changes from the training distribution, like a different texture on a box if Amazon suddenly prints differently on its packages. Monty could already be plugged into such pipelines, and we would be able to evaluate on some of these six degree of freedom object and pose detection benchmarks.

As shown in the DMC paper, the benefits of our approach are reduced cost and training, less data collection, robustness, continual learning, quick adaptation to new conditions, and generalization to objects with similar shapes. The next thing on our research roadmap, which we plan to achieve in the summer, is modeling compositional objects—stacking learning modules and using hierarchy to model compositional objects. This unlocks much more complex object recognition tasks. One application we've discussed a lot lately is ultrasound. In many remote areas, there aren't trained physicians to administer an ultrasound, which is a crucial technique for many diseases, especially maternal health. Checking that the baby is healthy and determining the baby's age can have significant implications if you can do those scans in remote areas. If you use mobile devices in combination with AI, they can become usable by untrained physicians. There are existing AI solutions, like blind sweeps, where you scan the belly in prescribed movements and use AI to determine fetal age, for example. These work well but require collecting large datasets. Niels and I just talked to someone who mentioned 10,000 subjects to try their model on. Monty won't require collecting large datasets, so it can be used for rarer conditions and is generally much cheaper to train for other things. Besides fetal age, it can also learn continually and adapt in the application to the specific population where it's being used. It can suggest where to move the probe to get necessary information instead of relying on prescribed movements. It can detect abnormalities without training on examples of them. That's significant because you could train Monty only on healthy fetuses, and when it sees a new fetus, if its predictions are wrong, it has a high prediction error and can recognize an abnormality, like something misshaped, and refer that person to a clinic for further checks, without ever needing to train on examples of these problems. It's also much more interpretable since we have these structured models, which is good in medical applications. Examples in maternal health include determining fetal age, identifying breach babies in the wrong position, and detecting the relative locations of objects, such as placenta previa, where the placenta is in the wrong position relative to the baby or malformation.

There are many opportunities to explore here, and we're currently looking into them further. I'll have more on this in the monthly review slides.

There are also other remote sensing applications, particularly in healthcare, that we've discussed more recently because that's the focus of the Gates Foundation. For example, detecting anemia in pregnant women to know whether to give IV fluids without a blood draw. They take videos of the eye and tongue, and you can predict anemia from that. Since they're already taking videos, Monty could potentially improve on this. Other applications include drones for larval source management of malaria mosquitoes, drones that serve health and water access in remote communities, or deliver medicine.

This is a more abstract example, but we've tried Monty on it before and realized it will need compositional objects. It's one of those benchmark datasets in the AI community with very little data—just a few examples of handwritten digits in different alphabets, and it has to learn from them. It's sensorimotor in the sense that we follow the strokes of these digits in datasets that show how AI can't learn from small datasets.

Another application is mapping disaster zones with drones or other robots that build a structured model of what's going on.

There's also scene understanding in existing pipelines, like warehouses, stacking boxes, or understanding how to grab the bottom box in a stack.

Waste management is a significant challenge that remains unsolved. Some automated systems can identify certain types of recyclables with 85 to 95 percent accuracy, but the process is far from perfect, and humans are still often needed to sort waste. The main issues involve deformations of objects, like crushed cans, and the wide variety of textures and labels, making it difficult to collect large enough datasets for recognition. Monty could recognize the general shape of a can, independent of the label. I categorized this under "blue plus deformation" because simply adding compositionality isn't enough; currently, we can't handle object deformation either.

Structured knowledge representations could improve search, enable new connections, and enhance teaching and learning. I asked ChatGPT to generate an image, and then to make it more concrete with an example, which highlighted how current AI struggles with this. For instance, it wrote, "the apple has flavor, red, and apple is a concept, and the plant is made of apple." If Monty can represent more abstract knowledge and form associative connections, we could achieve much better results.

The next major capability is modeling object behaviors and dynamic worlds, where objects move rather than remain static. This is an area we're currently brainstorming. Such modeling would help with ultrasound, where moving components like a beating heart, lungs, or a fetus need to be recognized, or at least their movement compensated for.

This capability is also crucial for self-driving cars and transportation, where recognizing and anticipating the pose of many moving objects is essential.

Grounded language understanding could be used to combat misinformation and generally improve language models by reducing hallucinations. This would be beneficial across sectors, especially agriculture, where weed detection, disease detection, and pest prevention are important. Many agricultural robots rely on sensorimotor systems, and Monty could have a significant impact here. Agriculture is vital for global food supply, so improvements in this area could have a very positive impact.

On a more abstract level, applications include cybersecurity and protein dynamics. I supervised a thesis on protein dynamics, where we have large static datasets but not dynamic states, as they're hard to record. Physics simulations are expensive and limited to small timescales. Some machine learning methods, like graph neural networks and variational autoencoders, can approximate these dynamics, but they quickly lose their physical grounding, start to hallucinate, and require large datasets or overfit.

Modeling the dynamic states of proteins is crucial for medical and pharmaceutical applications. Solving this could be a trillion-dollar industry and change the face of medicine. I'm not sure if Monty could achieve this, as it's a very complex area, but it's interesting to consider whether modeling object behaviors could have an impact. Understanding how proteins move and interact is important for studying misfolding in diseases like Alzheimer's, mutation effects, signaling, and pharmaceutical effects on the body.

Tristan, you shared the second version of the ARC challenge yesterday, which is a benchmark for AGI. I think Monty could perform well on this once we add these capabilities, as it requires learning from little data, reasoning, and structured knowledge—areas where Monty excels.

The next major capability is manipulating the world, which opens up new possibilities in robotics, such as caretaking. With fewer people willing to do these jobs and more people needing care, this would be valuable. Home helpers are another example; there's a quote: "I want AI to do my laundry and dishes so I can do art and writing, not for AI to do my art and writing so I can do my laundry and dishes." Hopefully, Monty can enable this, allowing us to focus on what we enjoy.

Other applications include dangerous jobs like mining, construction, firefighting, and policing, where robotics could be useful but current solutions are not general enough.

Space exploration is another area, as many environments are hostile to humans and rely on robots, especially on Mars. More intelligent robots would be very useful. In agriculture, manipulating the world rather than just detecting opens up automated picking, sorting, spraying, pruning, and more.

Another exciting possibility is AI scientists that design and run experiments. The sensorimotor system could generate hypotheses, design experiments, run them, analyze results, and iterate, leading to advances like curing diseases, addressing climate change, developing drought-resistant crops, renewable energies, and rapid vaccine development.

And then, generally tying into that, also logical reasoning. It doesn't necessarily need to be running experiments; it could be logical reasoning for other things. Can you expand a little bit on how manipulating the world leads into logical reasoning? Sure. I included it because knowing how to move through the world is similar to moving through conceptual space internally. Manipulating concepts in your head and imagining different combinations would be similar to manipulating objects in the world and putting them into different configurations. Perfect, thanks.

Feel free to interrupt.

Almost done. The last one is "plus" for all the other capabilities, and I already included a couple of other things in blue. Basically, having multi-agent systems might be a natural generalization since we already have these general learning modules that can communicate. It could generalize to them being separate agents still talking to each other. Generally, representing abstract concepts is something we're hoping will generalize from our algorithm without needing a specific mechanism. We'll have to see—scale, deformations, and theory of mind, which also relates to the multi-agent concept.

Now, the robots on Mars example: Mars is not a place for humans to go and start building, but a place where robots would need to go first and build a colony. It's such a different environment that it's hard to imagine how they would be pre-trained on large amounts of data on Earth and then go there and be able to operate. It would require an intelligence like ours, able to generalize and extrapolate to new environments, to be efficient and not break down when encountering unknown problems.

Education: potentially actual AI teaching children or adults, and also understanding intelligence in humans. One hope is that this project will lead to a full understanding of how our brain works, which should help treat mental disorders and inform the best ways to teach children and learn about the world.

The big theme is the hope that this will make the world a safer and healthier place, raise the standard of living, solve current problems and existential risks, and enable applications we can't even conceive of today.
